{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"1310901","division_id":9,"section":"RESULTS","text":"Absence of IRF-4 expression in leukemia cells is not due to promoter alterations\nWe have previously demonstrated a lack of IRF-4 expression in leukemia patients and specifically in CML T-cells (3). Here, we demonstrate the absence of IRF-4 expression in various hematopoietic cell lines, such as Jurkat, a T-cell leukemia, CML-T1, a bcr-abl-positive T-cell line, K-562, a bcr-abl-positve erythroleukemia, U-937, a monocytic leukemia, EM-2 and LAMA-84, bcr-abl-positve myeloid leukemia, but not in SD-1, a bcr-abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre B-ALL), RPMI-8226, a multiple myeloma and BV-173, a bcr-abl-positive B-cell line (Figures 1A and 5D). After sequencing of the IRF-4 promoter, it could be excluded that absence of IRF-4 expression in any of the above cell lines was due to genetic aberrations. However, 2 bp changes (nucleotide -1081, T to C and -1068, A to C) could be detected in both the IRF-4-positive BV-173 and the IRF-4-negative LAMA-84, EM-2 and K-562 (Figure 1B). At position -116 an A to C substitution was found in EM-2, K-562 and CML-T1, whereas Jurkat, BV-173 and SD-1 exhibited a mixed A/C sequence and U-937, LAMA-84 and RPMI-8226 no substitution at all (Figure 1B). Consequently, these alterations are unlikely to affect IRF-4 expression.","catanns":[{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":0,"end":7},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":11,"end":16},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":17,"end":27},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":53,"end":56},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":115,"end":119},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":123,"end":128},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":129,"end":139},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":234,"end":239},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":240,"end":250},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":333,"end":340},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":341,"end":349},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":372,"end":379},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":380,"end":387},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":452,"end":459},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":460,"end":467},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":505,"end":512},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":513,"end":521},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":608,"end":615},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":616,"end":624},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":682,"end":687},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":724,"end":731},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":735,"end":740},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":741,"end":751},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":912,"end":917},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":918,"end":926},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":942,"end":947},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":948,"end":956},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1251,"end":1257},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1258,"end":1263},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1264,"end":1274},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E1","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E9"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E10"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E11"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"E13","object":"E12"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E13"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E14"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E15"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"E17","object":"E16"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E17"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E6"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E15"},{"id":"M4","type":"Negation","object":"E16"},{"id":"M5","type":"Speculation","object":"E16"}]}
