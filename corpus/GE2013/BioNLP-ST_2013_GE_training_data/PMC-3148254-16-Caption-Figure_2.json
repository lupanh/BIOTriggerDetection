Transduction of both HOIP-deficient (HOIP-/-) clones with a retrovirus encoding FLAG-HOIP reversed defective CD80 upregulation, while transduction with an empty vector (pMIP) did not. Similar results were obtained in a second experiment.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":5,"end":13},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":18},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":19,"end":31},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":35,"end":44},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":48,"end":52},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":53,"end":62},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":193,"end":203},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":207,"end":211},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":355,"end":359},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":360,"end":369},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":371,"end":375},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":419,"end":423},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":424,"end":432},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":433,"end":442},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":443,"end":447},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":448,"end":460},"category":"Positive_regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"causeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E1","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E6"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E9"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E5"}]}
