The mechanism by which phosphodiesterase inhibition alters TNF-alpha production in the presence of LPS remains unclear.\nMETHODS\nHuman mononuclear cells were stimulated with LPS (1 mug/mL), in the presence and absence of Pentoxifylline (PTX; 20 mM), a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Western blotting of phosphorylated cytoplasmic I-kappaBalpha, nuclear factor-kappaB p65 (NF-kappaB), and nuclear cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) was performed. DNA binding of NF-kappaB and CREB was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. TNF-alpha levels were determined in the supernatant of stimulated cells in the presence and absence Protein kinase A inhibition by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nRESULTS\nPTX was demonstrated to significantly reduce cytoplasmic I-kappaBalpha phosphorylation, nuclear p65 phosphorylation, and the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB. In contrast, PTX markedly enhanced the phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of CREB. Cells concomitantly treated with PTX and LPS secreted similar levels of TNF-alpha in the presence and absence Protein kinase A inhibition.\nDISCUSSION\nThe increased level of cAMP that results from phosphodiesterase inhibition affects cytoplasmic and nuclear events, resulting in the attenuation of NF-kappaB and the activation of CREB transcriptional DNA binding through pathways that are partially Protein kinase A-independent.\nCONCLUSION\nPTX-mediated phosphodiesterase inhibition occurs partially through a Protein kinase A-independent pathway and may serve as a useful tool in the attenuation of LPS-induced inflammation.","catanns":[{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":18,"end":28},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":32,"end":41},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":42,"end":52},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":197,"end":203},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":287,"end":314},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":316,"end":325},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":327,"end":337},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":419,"end":429},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":433,"end":442},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":443,"end":452},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":583,"end":589},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":590,"end":599},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":600,"end":610},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":611,"end":629},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":843,"end":857},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":870,"end":883},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":907,"end":910},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1084,"end":1093},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1307,"end":1313},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1326,"end":1339},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1340,"end":1355},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1365,"end":1368},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1369,"end":1384},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1563,"end":1571},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1590,"end":1599},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1607,"end":1615},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1620,"end":1627},"category":"Regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E9"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E10"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E11"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"E14","object":"E13"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E12"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E14"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E15"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"E15","object":"E16"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"E15","object":"E17"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E17"}]}
