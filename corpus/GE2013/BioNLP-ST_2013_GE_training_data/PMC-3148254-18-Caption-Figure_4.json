{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"3148254","division_id":18,"section":"Caption-Figure 4","text":"CD40-induced activation of NF-kappaB and JNK is defective in HOIP-deficient cells.\nCD40-mediated signaling was defective in HOIP-deficient cells (HOIP-/- + pMIP), but intact in parental cells transduced with an empty retroviral vector (A20.2J + pMIP) and in HOIP-deficient cells transduced with a retroviral vector encoding HOIP (HOIP-/- + HOIP). Cells were activated with CD154-expressing insect cells for the times indicated. As a negative control, cells were stimulated with insect cells lacking CD154 (5 minute time point only). Western blots of whole-cell lysates were probed with the indicated antibodies. Phospho-IkappaBalpha (pIkappaBalpha) and phospho-JNK (pJNK) blots were stripped and reprobed for total IkappaBalpha and total JNK, respectively (anti-JNK antibodies recognize p46 and p54 isoforms). IkappaBalpha blots were also reprobed for actin to demonstrate equal lane loading. Molecular weights are indicated at right. Similar results were obtained in a second experiment and in two additional experiments with a second HOIP-deficient clone.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":61,"end":65},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":66,"end":75},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":83,"end":87},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":124,"end":128},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":129,"end":138},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":258,"end":262},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":263,"end":272},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":324,"end":328},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":330,"end":334},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":340,"end":344},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":373,"end":378},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":379,"end":389},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":491,"end":498},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":499,"end":504},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":612,"end":632},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":634,"end":647},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":715,"end":727},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":810,"end":822},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1036,"end":1040},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1041,"end":1050},"category":"Negative_regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T12","object":"T11"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E6"}]}
