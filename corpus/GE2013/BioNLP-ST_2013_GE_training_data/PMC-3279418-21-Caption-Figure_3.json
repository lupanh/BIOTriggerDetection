Supernatants were collected for ELISA of IL12P70, IL6, and GMCSF, and for quantification of nitric oxide (NO). (E-F) Gradient numbers (1x104, 2x104, and 4x104 cells in 0.1 mL complete medium) of BMDC were used for100 ng/mL LPS stimulation. After 24 hours, the amounts of IL12P70 and IL6 from the supernatant were measured. (G) The cpdm mice rescued by Sharpin-containing BAC had complete remission of the inflammatory phenotype [2]. BMDC developed from cpdm and rescued cpdm mice were plated (1x106 cells in 0.3 mL) and stimulated with 100 ng/mL LPS. After 24 hours, supernatants were collected for analysis of IL12P70 production. Data are representative of three independent experiments. * P<0.01; ** P<0.005.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":293,"end":296},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":302,"end":307},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":526,"end":529},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":595,"end":602},"category":"Protein"}]}
