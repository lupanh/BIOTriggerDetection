As a control, untreated cells were incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibody recognizing the active cleaved form of caspase-3. The blots were reblotted with beta-actin that served as a loading control. The ratio of active caspase-3 bands (17 kD and 19 kD) to beta-actin control was determined by densitometry analysis (bottom panel). Data represents the mean +/- S.E.M from two independent donors. (B) Apoptosis of the treated MDMs was also measured by Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodine (PI) staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of surviving cells (Annexin V/PI negative) for the cells treated with vehicle/M-CSF was arbitrarily set as 100. Data shown represent the mean +/- S.E.M from three independent experiments. *The p-values of inhibitors/M-CSF compared to vehicle/M-CSF were <=0.05.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":462,"end":472},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":520,"end":526},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":527,"end":536},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":564,"end":574},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":758,"end":767},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":875,"end":884},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":888,"end":896},"category":"Negative_regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E2"}]}
