{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"3279418","division_id":3,"section":"Results","text":"Phenotyping splenic DC and BMDC from WT and cpdm mice\nDC are heterogeneous and can be categorized into multiple subtypes based on surface markers [13]. To determine if the Sharpin mutation affects DC development in lymphoid tissues, mouse spleens were examined for the distribution of conventional DC (cDC; CD11c+CD8alpha+ and CD11c+CD8alpha-) [13] and plasmacytoid DC (pDC; CD11c-PDCA-1+) [14]. The percentages for splenic cDC and pDC were both reduced in cpdm mice when compared with WT controls (Fig. 2A). However, when gated on CD11c+ cDC, the percentages of CD8alpha+ and CD8alpha- cells were not affected by SHARPIN deficiency (Fig. 2A). Since the spleen of cpdm mice is markedly enlarged and contains three times as many cells (Fig. 1C), the different percentages of splenic cDC and pDC between WT and mutant mice reflect the increased number of total spleen cells rather than a reduction in cDC and pDC numbers. These data indicate that the Sharpin mutation does not affect the distribution of the examined DC subsets in the spleen.\nBMDC from in vitro cultures functionally resemble non-lymphoid tissue DC and monocyte-derived inflammatory DC [15], [16]. The yields of BMDC from WT and cpdm mice were similar. BMDC were CD11c+ and MHC II+ with low expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86. The TLR3 ligand poly I:C and the TLR4 ligand LPS each activate overlapping but different signaling pathways and were used to induce DC maturation [17], [18]. Incubation with the TLR agonists for 24 hours resulted in increased expression of CD40, CD80, and CD86 on BMDC; however, there was no difference in the expression levels of these markers between WT and cpdm BMDC (Fig. 2B). Thus, SHARPIN deficiency did not influence the expression of co-stimulatory molecules by BMDC.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":172,"end":179},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":180,"end":188},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":307,"end":312},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":313,"end":321},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":327,"end":332},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":333,"end":337},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":375,"end":380},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":381,"end":387},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":614,"end":621},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":622,"end":632},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":949,"end":956},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":957,"end":965},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1228,"end":1233},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1295,"end":1299},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1301,"end":1305},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1311,"end":1315},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1321,"end":1325},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1326,"end":1332},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1350,"end":1354},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1355,"end":1361},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1529},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1533,"end":1542},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1543,"end":1553},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1557,"end":1561},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1563,"end":1567},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1573,"end":1577},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1609,"end":1619},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1627,"end":1637},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1648,"end":1661},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1704,"end":1711},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1712,"end":1722},"category":"Negative_regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E18","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E19","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E20","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E21","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T20","object":"T16"},{"id":"R2","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T20","object":"T17"},{"id":"R3","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T20","object":"T18"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E2"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E3"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T14","object":"E4"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E5"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E6"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"E11","object":"E10"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E7"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"E13","object":"E9"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"E14","object":"E11"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"T16","object":"E12"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E13"},{"id":"R18","type":"themeOf","subject":"T18","object":"E14"},{"id":"R19","type":"themeOf","subject":"E16","object":"E15"},{"id":"R20","type":"themeOf","subject":"E18","object":"E17"},{"id":"R21","type":"themeOf","subject":"E20","object":"E19"},{"id":"R22","type":"themeOf","subject":"T16","object":"E16"},{"id":"R23","type":"themeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E18"},{"id":"R24","type":"themeOf","subject":"T18","object":"E20"},{"id":"R25","type":"themeOf","subject":"T19","object":"E21"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E15"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E17"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E19"}]}
