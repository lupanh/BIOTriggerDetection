Ziegler (Benaroya Research Institute). pEGFP-C2 was provided by I. Lipinski (NIDDK/NIH). pcDNA3 was provided by K. T. Jeang (NIAID/NIH). pCMV4-Tax was a generous gift from W. Greene (University of California San Francisco). pGL4-luc2 and pGL4-TKhRluc2 were purchased from Promega (Madison, Wisconsin, United States). pUC18 was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, California, United States). HIV-1 wt LTR and HIV-1 delta-kappaB LTR luciferase reporter vectors were constructed by cloning the XhoI/HindIII LTR fragments from pHIV-CAT and pdelta-kappaB-HIV-CAT (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID/NIH) into the multiple cloning site of pGL4-luc2. NF-kappaB, HTLV-I LTR, and CREB luciferase reporter and pCMV-p300-HA expression vectors were generously provided by B. Wigdahl (Drexel University College of Medicine). HTLV-I pACH infectious molecular clone has been described previously [30]. pFR-luc, pFA-CMV, pFA2-CREB-1, and pFA2-c-Jun were purchased from Stratagene. pFA-Tax (encoding a fusion protein consisting of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused in-frame to HTLV-I Tax) was constructed by PCR amplification of HTLV-I Tax using pCMV4-Tax as a template and BamHI/BglII-tagged primers. The amplified insert was digested and ligated into the BamHI/BglII sites of pFA-CMV. Plasmid contents were confirmed by DNA sequencing.","catanns":[{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":10,"end":20},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":44,"end":49},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":56,"end":61},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":83,"end":88},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":89,"end":96},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":101,"end":122},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":320,"end":323},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":609,"end":619},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":706,"end":709},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":732,"end":735},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":870,"end":880},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":899,"end":903},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":907,"end":917},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1104,"end":1110},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1121,"end":1126},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1163,"end":1166},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1212,"end":1216},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1261,"end":1264},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1313,"end":1316},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1329,"end":1332},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T19","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"partOf","subject":"T19","object":"T3"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E5"}]}
