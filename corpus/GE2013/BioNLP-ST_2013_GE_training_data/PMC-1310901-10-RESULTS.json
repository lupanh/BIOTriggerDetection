A region including exon1 in the IRF-4 promoter exhibited a large number of CpG-rich sequences (Figure 3A). Several chemical substances such as 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (AzadC) or 5-azacytidine (AzaC) inhibit de novo and maintenance methylation, and thus can be used to discern promoter methylation (32,33). We used AzadC to generate unmethylated DNA. A 72 h AzadC-treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent activation of IRF-4 transcription in Jurkat and CML-T1 T-cells as well as in U-937, K-562 and EM-2 cell lines (Figure 2A). IRF-4 transcription was induced in a time-dependent manner and was observed as early as 24 h after treatment with AzadC and increased over time until 72 h (Figure 2B). Time and strength of the appearance of IRF-4 transcripts varied among cell lines, i.e. CML-T1 responded strongest to AzadC-treatment (data not shown). In line with this, AzadC-treatment of CML-T1 and LAMA-84 cells also translated in an induction of IRF-4 protein expression (Figure 2C). Accordingly, treatment of the IRF-4-positive cell line BV-173, SD-1 and RPMI-8226 with AzadC had no effect on IRF-4 expression (Figure 2D). There was no difference in the effects of AzaC versus AzadC, as both increased the IRF-4 mRNA level in CML-T1 cells as well (data not shown). This implied that promoter methylation may control IRF-4 expression, but an alternative explanation may be activation of positive transcriptional regulators of IRF-4 by AzadC (or AzaC).","catanns":[{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":0,"end":8},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":12,"end":17},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":18,"end":28},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":172,"end":177},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":178,"end":188},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":222,"end":227},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":599,"end":609},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":613,"end":618},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":619,"end":632},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":722,"end":727},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":728,"end":741},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":746,"end":753},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":846,"end":855},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":929,"end":934},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":935,"end":946},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1139,"end":1144},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1207,"end":1212},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1213,"end":1221},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1277,"end":1283},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1287,"end":1292},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1293,"end":1303},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1386,"end":1395},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1400,"end":1405},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1406,"end":1416},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1502,"end":1509},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1510,"end":1515},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1516,"end":1526},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1619,"end":1624},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E9"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E10"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E11"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E12"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"E14","object":"E13"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E14"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"E16","object":"E15"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E16"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E11"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E15"}]}
