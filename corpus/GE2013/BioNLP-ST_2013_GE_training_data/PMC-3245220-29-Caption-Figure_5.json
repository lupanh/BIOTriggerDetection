Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-IkappaBalpha antibody. Data are representative of three independent experiments. (B) MDMs were pretreated with either vehicle or Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes before the addition of M-CSF for 10 minutes. Whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and phospho-Ser276 or phospho-Ser536 of NF-kappaB p65 was detected using phospho-specific antibodies to either residue of NF-kappaB p65. (C) Whole cell lysates of RAW 264.7 cells treated with vehicle control or Ro-31-8220 in the absence or presence of M-CSF were subjected to Western blot analysis with phospho-Ser276 or phospho-Ser536 NF-kappaB p65 antibodies. (D) Cytosolic and nuclear fractions of RAW 264.7 were obtained from the treated cells and immunoblotted for phospho-NF-kappaB. The purity of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions was confirmed by immunoblotting with GAPDH and Lamin B, respectively. Shown are representative blots from three independent experiments.","catanns":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":36,"end":44},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":45,"end":57},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":58,"end":69},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":74,"end":83},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":88,"end":103},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":117,"end":120},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":124,"end":130},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":603,"end":610},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":611,"end":617},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":621,"end":628},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":629,"end":635},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":649,"end":652},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":731,"end":734},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"partOf","subject":"T9","object":"T2"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"partOf","subject":"T11","object":"T3"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E6"},{"id":"R9","type":"partOf","subject":"T13","object":"T3"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E5"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E6"}]}
