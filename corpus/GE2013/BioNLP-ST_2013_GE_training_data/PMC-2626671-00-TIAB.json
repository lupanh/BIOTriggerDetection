CTLs lyse infected or aberrant target cells by exocytosis of lytic granules containing the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of proteases termed granzymes. We show that effector CTL differentiation occurs in two sequential phases in vitro, characterized by early induction of T-bet and late induction of Eomesodermin (Eomes), T-box transcription factors that regulate the early and late phases of interferon (IFN) gamma expression, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate a critical role for the transcription factor Runx3 in CTL differentiation. Runx3 regulates Eomes expression as well as expression of three cardinal markers of the effector CTL program: IFN-gamma, perforin, and granzyme B. Our data point to the existence of an elaborate transcriptional network in which Runx3 initially induces and then cooperates with T-box transcription factors to regulate gene transcription in differentiating CTLs.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":113,"end":116},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":327,"end":335},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":487,"end":496},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":500,"end":505},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":515,"end":524},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":528,"end":540},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":542,"end":547},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":550,"end":577},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":583,"end":591},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":621,"end":643},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":644,"end":654},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":743,"end":748},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":773,"end":778},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":779,"end":788},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":789,"end":794},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":795,"end":805},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":817,"end":827},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":831,"end":853},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":883,"end":892},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":894,"end":902},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":908,"end":918},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1001,"end":1006},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T15","object":"T4"},{"id":"R2","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T15","object":"T5"},{"id":"R3","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T16","object":"T11"},{"id":"R4","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T16","object":"T12"},{"id":"R5","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T16","object":"T13"},{"id":"R7","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T6","object":"T5"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E1"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E2"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R11","type":"causeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E5"},{"id":"R13","type":"causeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E5"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E4"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E6"},{"id":"R16","type":"causeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E6"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R18","type":"causeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R19","type":"themeOf","subject":"E11","object":"E10"},{"id":"R20","type":"causeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E10"},{"id":"R21","type":"themeOf","subject":"E13","object":"E12"},{"id":"R22","type":"causeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E12"},{"id":"R23","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E7"},{"id":"R24","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E9"},{"id":"R25","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E11"},{"id":"R26","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E13"}]}
