Promoter methylation of CpG target sites or direct deletions/insertions of genes are mechanisms of a reversible or permanent silencing of gene expression, respectively. Therefore, we investigated whether IRF-4 promoter methylation or mutation may be involved in the regulation of IRF-4 expression in leukemia cells. Whereas promoter mutations or structural rearrangements could be excluded as a cause of altered IRF-4 expression in hematopoietic cells, the IRF-4 promoter methylation status was found to significantly influence IRF-4 transcription. First, treatment of IRF-4-negative lymphoid, myeloid and monocytic cell lines with the methylation-inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase of IRF-4 mRNA and protein levels. Second, using a restriction-PCR-assay and bisulfite-sequencing we identified specifically methylated CpG sites in IRF-4-negative but not in IRF-4-positive cells. Third, we clearly determined promoter methylation as a mechanism for IRF-4 down-regulation via reporter gene assays, but did not detect an association of methylational status and mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases or methyl-CpG-binding proteins. Together, these data suggest CpG site-specific IRF-4 promoter methylation as a putative mechanism of down-regulated IRF-4 expression in leukemia.","catanns":[{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":0,"end":15},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":19,"end":49},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":55,"end":65},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":158,"end":161},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":162,"end":165},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":305,"end":317},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":321,"end":332},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":367,"end":397},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":399,"end":404},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":658,"end":663},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":720,"end":730},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":734,"end":739},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":740,"end":750},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":858,"end":865},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":866,"end":871},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":872,"end":882},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":911,"end":916},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":972,"end":981},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":982,"end":987},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":988,"end":1001},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1023,"end":1028},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1029,"end":1037},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1134,"end":1142},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1182,"end":1190},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1194,"end":1199},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1339,"end":1344},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1345,"end":1353},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1365,"end":1370},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1371,"end":1379},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1456,"end":1461},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1462,"end":1477},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1687,"end":1692},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1741,"end":1755},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1756,"end":1761},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1762,"end":1772},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T34"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T35"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T18","object":"T4"},{"id":"R3","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T5","object":"T4"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E5"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E6"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E9"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E10"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E11"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E12"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E13"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"T14","object":"E14"},{"id":"R18","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E15"},{"id":"R19","type":"themeOf","subject":"E17","object":"E16"},{"id":"R20","type":"themeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E17"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E4"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E10"},{"id":"M4","type":"Negation","object":"E13"},{"id":"M5","type":"Speculation","object":"E16"}]}
