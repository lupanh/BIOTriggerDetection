A complete methylation of these constructs was checked via restriction assays with methylation-sensitive endonucleases (Figure 5A). Intriguingly, methylation of the IRF-4 promoter significantly decreased promoter activity in IRF-4-positive SD-1 cells by 85.0% (Figure 5B). The silencing effect of CpG methylation was not restricted to IRF-4-positive cells, since in vitro methylation led to a 92.9% abrogation of promoter activity in IRF-4-negative Jurkat cells (Figure 5C). In contrast, control methylation of a reporter construct with a different promoter (FasL) as well as an empty vector had no effect on the reporter activity (data not shown). These data proved a direct association between methylation and activity of the IRF-4 promoter.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":27,"end":32},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":151,"end":156},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":214,"end":219},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":450,"end":455},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":479,"end":488},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":489,"end":497},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":510,"end":515},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":516,"end":524},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":620,"end":625},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":626,"end":634},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":684,"end":694},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":698,"end":706},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":719,"end":724},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":725,"end":733},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":844,"end":848},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1018},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"partOf","subject":"T11","object":"T4"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"partOf","subject":"T15","object":"T7"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E5"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E5"}]}
