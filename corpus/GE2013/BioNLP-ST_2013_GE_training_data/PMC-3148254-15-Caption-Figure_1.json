{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"3148254","division_id":15,"section":"Caption-Figure 1","text":"HOIP gene targeting.\n(A) Regions of Rnf31 gene sequence (bottom) used in the HOIP gene targeting vector (top) are shown. Arrows (F and R) indicate approximate positions of sequences homologous to oligonucleotides used for PCR-mediated detection of homologous recombination. Homologous recombination of the vector with Rnf31 resulted in a small chromosomal deletion and the in-frame insertion of neomycin phosphotransferase (NeoR) into the amino-terminal HOIP coding sequence. A diphtheria toxin (DT) cassette in the vector facilitates the negative selection of cells in which random chromosomal insertion of the vector takes place. LoxP sequences allow the Cre-mediated deletion of the NeoR coding sequence. The SV40pA sequence helps to ensure disruption of gene expression after deletion of the NeoR sequence. (B) Anti-HOIP and anti-FLAG Western blots of cell lysates from A20.2J cells and HOIP-deficient (HOIP-/-) clones. A partial decrease in HOIP protein expression is evident in cells following disruption of one copy of Rnf31 (HOIP-/+). HOIP expression in clones reconstituted with an empty retroviral vector (pMIP) or a retroviral vector encoding FLAG-tagged HOIP is also shown. Approximate molecular weight of HOIP is 120 kD.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":36,"end":41},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":77,"end":81},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":318,"end":323},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":454,"end":458},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":891,"end":895},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":896,"end":905},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":907,"end":911},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":934,"end":942},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":946,"end":950},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":959,"end":969},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":990,"end":999},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1000,"end":1010},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1026,"end":1031},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1033,"end":1037},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1043,"end":1047},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1048,"end":1058},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1166,"end":1170},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1218,"end":1222},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"causeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E6"}]}
