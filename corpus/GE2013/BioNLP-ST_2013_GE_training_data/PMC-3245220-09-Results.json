To confirm the role of PKCalpha in NF-kappaB activation in macrophages, constructs for either wildtype (WT)-PKCalpha or kinase-deficient (KD)-PKCalpha was co-transfected with the pNF-kappaB-SEAP reporter gene and SEAP secretion was measured. As shown in Figure 7A, MDMs co-transfected with pNF-kappaB-SEAP and WT-PKCalpha had a 1.8-fold increase in NF-kappaB transcriptional activity after M-CSF activation compared with NS cells (p = 0.05), similar to M-CSF-treated cells expressing only pNF-kappaB-SEAP. Transfecting human macrophages with the KD-PKCalpha construct significantly reduced M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB activity compared to WT-PKCalpha transfected cells (p = 0.016). Similarly, RAW 264.7 cells transfected with WT-PKCalpha had 2.5-fold more NF-kappaB transcriptional activity after M-CSF activation compared to unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells (NS) transfected with WT-PKCalpha (Figure 7B). Expression of the KD-PKCalpha construct into RAW 264.7 cells reduced M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB activity to 1.5-fold (p = 0.045) compared to cells transfected with WT PKCalpha.\nCell survival was also examined in MDMs expressing either WT-PKCalpha or KD-PKCalpha constructs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining. As expected, M-CSF increased MDM survival as measured by the percent of Annexin V/PI negative cells. Similarly, expression of WT-PKCalpha protected cells from apoptosis. In contrast, expression of KD-PKCalpha decreased M-CSF-induced cell survival (p<0.01) (Figure 7C).\nNext, we examined the effect of expressing the PKCalpha constructs on NF-kappaB phosphorylation. As shown in Figure 7D, expression of KD-PKCalpha in RAW 264.7 cells did not affect the constitutive phosphorylation at Ser536 of NF-kappaB p65, but attenuated the phosphorylation at Ser276. Expression of WT-PKCalpha did not effect the phosphorylation of either residue with or without M-CSF stimulation. These observations demonstrate that PKCalpha is important in M-CSF-regulated cell survival and NF-kappaB activation and likely regulated through phosphorylation of Ser276 of NF-kappaB p65.\nTo further validate the impact that PKCalpha played in M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, we next employed PKCalpha siRNA treatment of MDM or RAW cells. A pool of specific PKCalpha siRNA were transfected into MDM or Raw 264.7 cells in the presence or absence or M-CSF. Reducing native PKCalpha expression decreased M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in both MDM (Figure 7E) (p = 0.012) and Raw 264.7 cells (Figure 7F) (p = 0.01). We also examined cell survival of the MDMs by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining after PKCalpha siRNA transfection. As shown in Figure 7G, M-CSF-induced MDM survival was reduced in the cells transfected with PKCalpha siRNA compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (p = 0.047). In Figure 7H, we confirmed that PKCalpha siRNA transfection decreased PKCalpha protein expression in both MDM and Raw 264.7 cells. Our results indicated that PKCalpha regulated NF-kappaB activation and M-CSF-regulated cell survival.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":147,"end":155},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":156,"end":160},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":161,"end":171},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":261,"end":269},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":353,"end":361},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":438,"end":446},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":450,"end":466},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":472,"end":480},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":485,"end":499},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":600,"end":614},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":643,"end":651},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":876,"end":878},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":879,"end":887},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":968,"end":976},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":977,"end":988},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":1035,"end":1046},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1055,"end":1063},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":1186,"end":1197},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1206,"end":1214},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1246,"end":1248},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1249,"end":1257},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":1372,"end":1383},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1392,"end":1400},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":1442,"end":1452},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1463,"end":1471},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":1475,"end":1477},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1478,"end":1486},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1501,"end":1510},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1605,"end":1614},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":1618,"end":1626},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":1645,"end":1655},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1662,"end":1670},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":1730,"end":1732},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1733,"end":1741},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":1834,"end":1844},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1849,"end":1857},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":1936,"end":1938},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1939,"end":1947},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":1975,"end":1981},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":1999,"end":2014},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":2018,"end":2024},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":2038,"end":2041},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":2047,"end":2057},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":2062,"end":2077},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":2081,"end":2087},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":2089,"end":2099},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2106,"end":2114},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":2123,"end":2129},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":2134,"end":2149},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2153,"end":2167},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":2168,"end":2183},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2239,"end":2247},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":2348,"end":2363},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":2367,"end":2373},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2387,"end":2390},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2428,"end":2436},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2514,"end":2528},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2579,"end":2593},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":2676,"end":2684},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2692,"end":2700},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":2701,"end":2711},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2897,"end":2906},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2934,"end":2948},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":3055,"end":3069},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":3166,"end":3180},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":3194,"end":3203},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":3204,"end":3212},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":3221,"end":3231},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":3292,"end":3300},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T37"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T37"},{"id":"E3","type":"in
