For co-transfection studies, PKCalpha or NF-kappaB p65 constructs were mixed at a ratio of 5:1 with the reporter plasmid. For siRNA transfection, 100 nM of PKCalpha siRNA or control siRNA were used. Cells were incubated with the transfection reagents for 16-24 hours, washed and starved in RPMI without FBS for 4 hours. Samples were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml M-CSF for 4 hours at which point the medium was collected for the SEAP analysis. For inhibition studies, cells were pre-incubated with inhibitors for 30 minutes before M-CSF treatment. On average, we realized 30-40% transfection efficiency as confirmed by GFP expression in Raw 264.7 cells.","catanns":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":388,"end":403},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":413,"end":421},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":435,"end":438},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":540,"end":554},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1007},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1008,"end":1018},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E3"}]}
