Cells (1.5 x 106) were fixed by sequential formaldehyde/methanol fixation as follows. Cells were carefully resuspended in FACS buffer and fixed with 100 mul of reagent A (Fix & Perm kit; Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, California, United States) at room temperature for 3 min followed by 2 ml of 70% methanol for 5 min at 4 degreesC. Cells were washed twice and permeabilized with 100 mul of reagent B (Fix & Perm kit) and stained for intracellular Foxp3 with mouse anti-human Foxp3 monoclonal antibody (0.5 mug of ab22510; Abcam) or the appropriate isotype control for 30 min. Cells were washed twice and stained with Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin F(ab')2 secondary antibody (Caltag Laboratories) for an additional 30 min. Cells were washed twice and stained for surface CD4 expression with PE-labeled anti-CD4 (BD) and CD25 expression with FITC-labeled anti-CD25 (BD). Cells were washed twice and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, Oregon, United States).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":33},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":42,"end":52},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":638,"end":643},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":666,"end":671},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":977,"end":980},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":981,"end":991},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1016},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1026,"end":1030},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1031,"end":1041},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1069},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E3"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"}]}
