The transcription factor Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a key regulator of genes involved in M-CSF-induced mononuclear phagocyte survival and this study focused at identifying the mechanism of NF-kappaB transcriptional activation. Here, we demonstrate that M-CSF stimulated NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. The general protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Ro-31-8220, the conventional PKCalpha/beta inhibitor Go-6976, overexpression of dominant negative PKCalpha constructs and PKCalpha siRNA reduced NF-kappaB activity in response to M-CSF. Interestingly, Ro-31-8220 reduced Ser276 phosphorylation of NF-kappaBp65 leading to decreased M-CSF-induced monocyte survival. In this report, we identify conventional PKCs, including PKCalpha as important upstream kinases for M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activation, NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression, NF-kappaB p65 Ser276 phosphorylation, and macrophage survival. Lastly, we find that NF-kappaB p65 Ser276 plays an important role in basal and M-CSF-stimulated NF-kappaB activation in human mononuclear phagocytes.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":56,"end":59},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":60,"end":75},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":79,"end":85},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":692,"end":700},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":701,"end":705},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":706,"end":715},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":725,"end":739},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":743,"end":769},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":785,"end":799},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":875,"end":882},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":883,"end":889},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":890,"end":905},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":918,"end":921},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1033,"end":1041},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1045,"end":1054},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1082,"end":1089},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1175,"end":1178},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1179,"end":1185},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1186,"end":1201},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1259,"end":1262},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"partOf","subject":"T11","object":"T1"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E6"},{"id":"R8","type":"partOf","subject":"T15","object":"T6"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T19","object":"E9"},{"id":"R12","type":"partOf","subject":"T19","object":"T8"}]}
