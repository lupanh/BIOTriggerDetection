T cells were recovered from the inguinal lymph nodes 3 days after priming and restimulated in vitro with OVA peptide for 48 hr. This in vivo immunization induced IL-10 and IFN-gamma production, and the amount of IL-10 production was enhanced by addition of LPS in the immunization (Figure 3A) and with higher doses of OVA (3 muM versus 1 muM, data not shown). To test the role of STAT4 and STAT6 signaling in the in vivo development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we transferred STAT4- or STAT6-deficient or WT DO11.10 cells into recipient BALB/c mice and immunized with OVA-protein plus LPS as before. In vivo expression of both IL-10 and IFN-gamma was markedly reduced but not completely abrogated in the absence of STAT4 signaling (Figures 3B and 3C), suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms that were absent in the in vitro system. Signaling through STAT6 had no effect on IL-10 production by Th1 cells as shown by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and by immunoassay in STAT6-deficient T cells (Figures 3B and 3C).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":23,"end":28},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":72,"end":77},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":78,"end":87},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":124,"end":134},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":135,"end":140},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":141,"end":151},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":283,"end":286},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":447,"end":450},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":496,"end":503},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":504,"end":509},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":514,"end":523},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":524,"end":534},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":554,"end":559},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":560,"end":570},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":575,"end":583},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":660,"end":663},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":722,"end":727},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":732,"end":737},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":778,"end":783},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":784,"end":793},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":820,"end":825},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":830,"end":835},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":836,"end":845},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":912,"end":915},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":952,"end":962},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":971,"end":976},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":981,"end":990},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1011},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1020,"end":1040},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1059,"end":1064},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1207,"end":1212},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1220,"end":1226},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1230,"end":1235},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1236,"end":1246},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1332,"end":1337},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1338,"end":1347},"category":"Negative_regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"},{"id":"E18","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"},{"id":"E19","type":"instanceOf","object":"T34"},{"id":"E20","type":"instanceOf","object":"T35"},{"id":"E21","type":"instanceOf","object":"T36"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E6"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E9"},{"id":"R10","type":"causeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E9"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E10"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E11"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T14","object":"E12"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T16","object":"E13"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E14"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"E13","object":"E15"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"E14","object":"E16"},{"id":"R18","type":"themeOf","subject":"E13","object":"E17"},{"id":"R19","type":"themeOf","subject":"E14","object":"E18"},{"id":"R20","type":"themeOf","subject":"E20","object":"E19"},{"id":"R21","type":"themeOf","subject":"T20","object":"E20"},{"id":"R22","type":"themeOf","subject":"T21","object":"E21"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E17"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E18"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E19"}]}
