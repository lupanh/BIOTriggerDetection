Allogeneic naive CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleens of BALB/c mice by negative selection kit (Invitrogen) and were then added at 2.5x105 and co-cultured with activated BMDC. After 5 days, supernatant was collected and the secretion of IFNgamma, IL4, IL2, and IL17A measured by ELISA. Negative controls are 1) stimulated BMDC without co-culture with allogeneic CD4+ T cells; 2) allogeneic CD4+ T cells without co-culture with stimulated BMDC. Both negative controls show no production of aforementioned cytokines.","catanns":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":427,"end":436},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":440,"end":448},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":450,"end":453},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":455,"end":458},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":464,"end":469},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":678,"end":688},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":692,"end":716},"category":"Anaphora"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T5","object":"T1"},{"id":"R2","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T5","object":"T2"},{"id":"R3","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T5","object":"T3"},{"id":"R4","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T5","object":"T4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E4"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E5"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E6"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E7"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E8"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M4","type":"Speculation","object":"E4"},{"id":"M5","type":"Negation","object":"E5"},{"id":"M6","type":"Negation","object":"E6"},{"id":"M7","type":"Negation","object":"E7"},{"id":"M8","type":"Negation","object":"E8"}]}
