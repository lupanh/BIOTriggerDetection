IL4 transcription was detectable with control RNA and faintly in the mouse lymphoma cell line K46mu (Figure 4A). However, IL4 transcription was not detectable in CD19+ MACS-purified B cells from wild-type lymphocytes (unpublished data), LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes, or lymphoma cells, although the GAPDH and L32 controls were effectively protected (Figure 4A). Activated Stat6 (pStat6), a target of the IL4 receptor pathway, was detected in the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes (Figure 4B). In contrast, pStat6 was barely detected in either the wild-type or LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells. However, the pathway was not disabled, as treatment of the lymphoma cells with IL4 induced Stat6 phosphorylation (Figure 4C).\nAlthough wild-type lymphocytes cannot be maintained in culture with IL4 supplementation alone (Figure 3A), slight enhancement in MTS activity could be detected if the cells were analyzed at an earlier time point, at 1 d (Figure 4D) versus 3 d (Figure 3A) post-harvest. The enhancement of MTS activity induced by IL4 in wild-type lymphocytes could be neutralized by the addition of IL4 antibody (Figure 4D). However, neutralizing antibodies to IL4 did not affect the MTS activity of LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells (Figure 4E). In summary, the wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells grew independently of IL4 treatment and did not require Stat6 signaling.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":18},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":60,"end":63},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":68,"end":73},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":107,"end":110},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":146,"end":149},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":150,"end":160},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":162,"end":165},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":166,"end":179},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":229,"end":232},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":233,"end":246},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":351,"end":354},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":355,"end":368},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":391,"end":395},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":466,"end":470},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":527,"end":532},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":537,"end":540},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":590,"end":599},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":600,"end":605},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":607,"end":613},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":618,"end":624},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":632,"end":644},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":688,"end":692},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":796,"end":800},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":907,"end":910},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":911,"end":918},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":919,"end":924},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":925,"end":940},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1025},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1266,"end":1269},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1335,"end":1338},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1397,"end":1400},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1436,"end":1440},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1510,"end":1514},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1563,"end":1566},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1597,"end":1602},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T34"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T35"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T14","object":"T13"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E1"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E6"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R9","type":"causeOf","subject":"T18","object":"E7"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T19","object":"E8"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E4"}]}
