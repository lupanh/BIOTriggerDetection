Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF, IL-6 and CXCL8 are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis and AIDS. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the transcription factors, AP-1 and NF-kappaB, in IL-6 and CXCL8 regulation in Jurkat T-cells.\nResults\nPhorbol myristate acetate (PMA) exposure resulted in an up-regulation of AP-1 and down-regulation of NF-kappaB activity, however, exposure to heat killed (HK) Escherichia. coli MG1655 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in NF-kappaB activity without affecting AP-1. The cytokine profile revealed an up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL8 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-2 and IL-6 following treatment with both PMA and HK E. coli, while the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were not affected by PMA but were significantly down-regulated by HK E. coli. AP-1 activation was significantly increased 2 h after PMA exposure and continued to increase thereafter. In contrast, NF-kappaB responded to PMA exposure by a rapid up-regulation followed by a subsequent down-regulation. Increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations countered the down-regulation of NF-kappaB by PMA, while similar treatment with calcium ionophore resulted in a reduced NF-kappaB activity following induction with HK E. coli. In order to further study NF-kappaB activation, we considered two up-stream signalling proteins, PKC and Bcl10. Phosphorylated-PKC levels increased in response to PMA and HK E. coli, while Bcl10 levels significantly decreased following PMA treatment. Using an NF-kappaB activation inhibitor, we observed complete inhibition of IL-6 expression while CXCL8 levels only decreased by 40% at the highest concentration. Treatment of Jurkat T-cells with PMA in the presence of JNK-inhibitor suppressed both CXCL8 and IL-6 while PKC-inhibitor primarily decreased CXCL8 expression.\nConclusion\nThe present study shows that NF-kappaB regulated IL-6 but not CXCL8. This complex regulation of CXCL8 suggests that there is a need to further evaluate the signalling pathways in order to develop new treatment for diseases with elevated CXCL8 levels, such as AIDS and autoimmune diseases.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":341,"end":345},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":350,"end":355},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":500,"end":504},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":558,"end":562},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":567,"end":572},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":573,"end":583},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":912,"end":925},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":943,"end":948},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":989,"end":993},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":998,"end":1002},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1104,"end":1109},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1119,"end":1127},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1158,"end":1172},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1734,"end":1739},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1818,"end":1823},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1845,"end":1854},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1942,"end":1952},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1956,"end":1960},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1961,"end":1971},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1978,"end":1983},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1996,"end":2005},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2113,"end":2123},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":2129,"end":2134},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":2139,"end":2143},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2174,"end":2183},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":2184,"end":2189},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2190,"end":2200},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2252,"end":2261},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":2262,"end":2266},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":2275,"end":2280},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2295,"end":2305},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":2309,"end":2314},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2441,"end":2449},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":2450,"end":2455},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E18","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E19","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E20","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"},{"id":"E21","type":"instanceOf","object":"T34"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E9"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E10"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E11"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E12"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E13"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E14"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T14","object":"E15"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"E17","object":"E16"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E17"},{"id":"R18","type":"themeOf","subject":"T16","object":"E18"},{"id":"R19","type":"themeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E19"},{"id":"R20","type":"themeOf","subject":"T18","object":"E20"},{"id":"R21","type":"themeOf","subject":"T19","object":"E21"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E8"},{"id":"M4","type":"Negation","object":"E18"},{"id":"M5","type":"Negation","object":"E19"}]}
