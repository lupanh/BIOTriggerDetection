LPS stimulation caused a negligible increase in CREB phosphorylation when compared to control (Figure 4A). PTX alone caused a marked increase in CREB phosphorylation (P < 0.01 vs. HBSS). When LPS and PTX exposure occurred simultaneously, CREB phosphorylation was significantly higher than with LPS stimulation alone (543 +/- 92 vs. 100 +/- 0; P < 0.01). In addition, the amount of CREB phosphorylation seen with concomitant LPS and PTX treatment was less than that seen with PTX alone, although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.08).\nTo determine if CREB-DNA binding was affected by PTX in a manner similar to CREB phosphorylation, an EMSA was performed. Exposure of LPS-stimulated cells to PTX similarly increased CREB DNA-binding compared to LPS alone (Figure 4B).","catanns":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":876,"end":885},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":886,"end":890},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":895,"end":902},"category":"Binding"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T2"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T3"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"}]}
