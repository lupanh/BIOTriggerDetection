After 48 hr, they were injected subcutaneously with PBS or with OVA protein (5 mg) plus LPS (5 mug). The inguinal lymph nodes were removed 48 hr later. A single-cell suspension (1 x 106 cells) was restimulated for 24 or 48 hr with 1 muM or 3 muM of OVA and with BrefeldinA for the last 6 hr. Half of the supernatant was removed before the addition of BrefeldinA for use in an ELISA assay. The cells were fixed and stained as before. Those positive for KJ1-26-Bio and for CD4-PerCP were gated, and IFN-gamma and IL-10 staining was examined for this population and analyzed as before.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":183,"end":187},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":188,"end":197},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":268,"end":271},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":453,"end":456},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":656,"end":662},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":675,"end":678},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":701,"end":710},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":715,"end":720},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"}]}
