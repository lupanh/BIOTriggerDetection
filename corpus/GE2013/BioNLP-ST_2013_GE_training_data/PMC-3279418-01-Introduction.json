{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"3279418","division_id":1,"section":"Introduction","text":"SHARPIN was originally identified in post-synaptic densities of excitatory synapses in the brain of rats [1], but this protein is widely expressed in a variety of tissues [2]. Two allelic, autosomal recessive mutations in the Sharpin gene occurred spontaneously in two inbred strains of mice, C57B/KaLawRij-Sharpincpdm/Sharpincpdm and CBy.Ocb3/Dem-Sharpincpdm-Dem/Sharpincpdm-Dem, resulting in premature termination of mRNA synthesis and absence of a functional protein product [2]. Despite different genetic backgrounds, both mutations cause similar inflammatory disease with severe chronic progressive dermatitis and defective development of secondary lymphoid organs [2]-[4]. The dermatitis becomes clinically apparent at about four weeks of age. There are accumulations of eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages in the skin of Sharpincpdm/Sharpincpdm mutant mice (hereafter referred to as cpdm mice) associated with increased expression of Th2 cytokines in the skin and in the supernatants of activated splenocytes [5]. The mice have an impaired delayed type hypersensitivity response and decreased secretion of IFNgamma [5], indicating a defect in Th1 immune responses and a bias towards a Th2 immune response. Systemic treatment of cpdm mice with recombinant IL12 caused complete remission of the dermatitis [5]. Neutralization of IL5 by antibody treatment or crosses with IL5-deficient mice reduced the number of circulating and cutaneous eosinophils, but failed to reduce the onset and severity of the dermatitis [6].\nRecently, three independent groups identified SHARPIN as an essential component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) that regulates TNFalpha-induced canonical NF-kappaB signaling [7]-[9]. SHARPIN-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) were sensitized to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis and cell death was implicated as a factor in the dermatitis of cpdm mice [7]-[9].\nDendritic cells (DC) have a sentinel role in sensing pathogen or danger signals and initiate and direct activation of the adaptive immune response [10]. Activated and mature DC can carry processed antigenic peptides, migrate to lymphoid organs, and induce T-cell-mediated immune responses or tolerance. DC direct the differentiation of CD4+ T cells, and hence the type of immune response, through the selective secretion of cytokines. We hypothesized that defective cytokine secretion by DC contributed to the Th2-biased inflammatory phenotype in SHARPIN-deficient mice. The studies reported here found that lack of SHARPIN protein in BMDC caused defective expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and impaired NF-kappaB activation upon ligand stimulation. The ability of cpdm BMDC to stimulate Th1 cytokine production in allogeneic CD4+ T cells was compromised. Taken together, these results reveal that SHARPIN is a novel regulatory molecule in DC biology and suggest that the dysregulated function of SHARPIN-deficient DC plays a role in the cpdm phenotype.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":7},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":114,"end":126},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":137,"end":146},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":199,"end":218},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":226,"end":233},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":381,"end":390},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":404,"end":415},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":419,"end":423},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":424,"end":433},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":438,"end":445},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":449,"end":477},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1095,"end":1104},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1105,"end":1114},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1118,"end":1126},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1321,"end":1335},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1339,"end":1342},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1381,"end":1384},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1385,"end":1394},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1574,"end":1581},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1678,"end":1686},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1734,"end":1741},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1742,"end":1751},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1804,"end":1812},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":2460,"end":2467},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2468,"end":2477},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2521,"end":2525},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":2529,"end":2536},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":2818,"end":2825},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":2917,"end":2924},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2925,"end":2934},"category":"Negative_regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T14","object":"T1"},{"id":"R2","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T15","object":"T2"},{"id":"R3","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T16","object":"T2"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R8","type":"causeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E3"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R10","type":"causeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E5"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E4"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E7"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E6"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E9"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E10"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E11"},{"id":"R18","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E12"},{"id":"R19","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E13"},{"id":"R20","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E14"},{"id":"R21","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E15"}]}
