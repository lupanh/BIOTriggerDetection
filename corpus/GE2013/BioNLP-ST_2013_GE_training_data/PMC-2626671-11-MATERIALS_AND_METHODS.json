After the coincubation period, cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC and anti-CD8-allophycocyanin. Data analysis was performed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.); EL4 target cells (CD8-negative events) were gated, and the percentage of Annexin V+ target cells was determined.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":165,"end":168},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":323,"end":332},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":347,"end":350},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":454,"end":457},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":509,"end":518},"category":"Protein"}]}
