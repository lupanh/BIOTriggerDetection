(A) Western analysis of Runx3, Eomes, T-bet, and perforin expression in Runx3+/+ versus Runx3-/- CD8+ SP T cells differentiated for 6 d. beta-Actin was used as a loading control. (B) Northern blot analysis of Prf1 mRNA expression in Runx3+/+ versus Runx3-/- CD8+ T cells differentiated for 6 d. beta-Actin was used as a loading control. (C) Expression of granzyme B, IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL-2 by resting or restimulated (6 h) Runx3+/+ versus Runx3-/- CD8+ SP T cells differentiated for 6 d. The vertical gray line indicates the granzyme B MFI for WT GFP+ cells. Results in A-C are representative of two independent experiments. (D) ChIP analysis of binding of endogenous Runx3 and Eomes to the Prf1 locus. Enrichment of the indicated genomic regions was evaluated by real-time PCR of DNA from immunoprecipitated and input chromatin. The data are the means of duplicate measurements from two chromatin preparations from two independent CD8+ T cell differentiations. The efficiency of recovery of input for the -1-kb region of Prf1 was 0.97% for the Runx3 ChIP and 0.5% for the Eomes ChIP.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":18},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":76,"end":81},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":83,"end":88},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":90,"end":95},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":101,"end":109},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":110,"end":120},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":124,"end":129},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":140,"end":145},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":149,"end":152},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":189,"end":199},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":261,"end":265},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":266,"end":281},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":285,"end":290},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":301,"end":306},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":310,"end":313},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":347,"end":357},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":393,"end":403},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":407,"end":417},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":419,"end":428},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":430,"end":433},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":439,"end":443},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":477,"end":482},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":493,"end":498},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":502,"end":505},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":579,"end":589},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":601,"end":604},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":700,"end":707},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":722,"end":727},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":732,"end":737},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":745,"end":749},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":986,"end":989},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1076,"end":1080},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1104},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1127,"end":1132},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T34"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T34"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T16","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T18","object":"E9"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T24","object":"E10"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T26","object":"E10"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T25","object":"E11"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T26","object":"E11"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M4","type":"Speculation","object":"E4"},{"id":"M5","type":"Speculation","object":"E5"},{"id":"M6","type":"Speculation","object":"E6"},{"id":"M7","type":"Speculation","object":"E7"},{"id":"M8","type":"Speculation","object":"E8"},{"id":"M9","type":"Speculation","object":"E9"},{"id":"M10","type":"Speculation","object":"E10"},{"id":"M11","type":"Speculation","object":"E11"}]}
