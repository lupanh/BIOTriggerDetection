We therefore quantitated the Foxp3 protein expression in CD4+CD25+ T cells by flow cytometry and the HTLV-I proviral load (a surrogate marker of viral replication) by real-time PCR from eight patients with HAM/TSP and eight asymptomatic carriers (ACs). The data from this analysis is summarized in Table 1. As expected, patients with HAM/TSP exhibited significantly higher proviral loads (indicated as HTLV-I proviral DNA copies/100 cells) (34.68 +/- 23.19) compared to ACs (4.75 +/- 5.47) (p = 0.0008). The percentage of Foxp3+ cells within the CD4+CD25+ T cell population was significantly greater in ACs (43.23 +/- 12.95) than in HAM/TSP patients (18.59 +/- 5.77) (p = 0.0033). These data suggest that high levels of Foxp3 protein expression are associated with reduced HTLV-I replication in vivo. They also support our recent reports that high proviral loads, which have been shown to correlate with high Tax mRNA in HTLV-I-infected patients, are associated with reduced Foxp3 expression [8,34].","catanns":[{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":0,"end":9},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":15},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":24,"end":34},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":85,"end":90},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":94,"end":103},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":130,"end":133},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":134,"end":138},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":261,"end":266},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":341,"end":346},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":355,"end":365},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":369,"end":372},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":373,"end":377},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":834,"end":839},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":858,"end":861},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":862,"end":866},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1021},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1032,"end":1037},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1056},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1216,"end":1220},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1221,"end":1224},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1279,"end":1286},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1287,"end":1292},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1293,"end":1303},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T14","object":"E9"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E4"}]}
