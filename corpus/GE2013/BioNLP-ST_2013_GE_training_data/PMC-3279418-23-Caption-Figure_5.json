Unstained cells serve as negative controls. (B) Cultured WT and cpdm BMDC (1x105 cells in 0.1 ml complete medium) were washed and stimulated with medium, 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 microg/ml poly I:C for 24 hours. Supernatants were collected for ELISA of IL10. (C) Cultured WT and cpdm BMDC (5x105 cells in 0.2 ml complete medium) were washed and stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 25 microg/ml poly I:C. At 0, 1, and 2 hours, total RNA was extracted and subject to qRT-PCR to measure the production of A20.","catanns":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":7,"end":11},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":16,"end":19},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":20,"end":30},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":35,"end":44},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":45,"end":49},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":50,"end":59},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":64,"end":67},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":68,"end":78},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":484,"end":488},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":716,"end":726},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":730,"end":733},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E6"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E9"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E9"}]}
