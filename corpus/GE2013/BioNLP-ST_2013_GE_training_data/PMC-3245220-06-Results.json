Since conventional PKC activity was important in regulating M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB activation, we next investigated whether IkappaBalpha degradation was regulated by PKC. Cells were treated with cyclohexamide (CHX) to inhibit protein synthesis of IkappaBalpha, and its degradation was followed. As shown in Figure 5A, PKC inhibition with Ro-31-8220 did not alter M-CSF-induced IkappaBalpha degradation, suggesting that M-CSF-induced PKC activity augmented NF-kappaB transcriptional activity by an alternative pathway, like post-translational modification of NF-kappaB p65.","catanns":[{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":43,"end":51},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":76,"end":79},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":80,"end":90},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":144,"end":159},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":164,"end":175},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":179,"end":191},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":258,"end":261},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":262,"end":265},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":445,"end":457},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":458,"end":469},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":474,"end":483},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":539,"end":546},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":555,"end":564},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":568,"end":580},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":678,"end":683},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":690,"end":697},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":698,"end":710},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":711,"end":722},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":767,"end":776},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":815,"end":837},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":844,"end":875},"category":"Protein_modification"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":889,"end":892},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T9","object":"T22"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E3"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E4"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E5"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E6"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E8"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E10","object":"E9"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"E11","object":"E10"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E11"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"E13","object":"E12"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E13"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E6"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E9"}]}
