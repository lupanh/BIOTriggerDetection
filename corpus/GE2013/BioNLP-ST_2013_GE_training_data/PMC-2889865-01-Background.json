{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"2889865","division_id":1,"section":"Background","text":"Cytokines and chemokines are important in immune cell recruitment and in regulation of inflammatory responses [1]. T-cells produce a broad range of inflammatory mediators, including IL-2, IL-6, TNF and CXCL8, all of which are important in cell proliferation, differentiation, communication and initiation of inflammatory responses [2]. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF, IL-6 and CXCL8, are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis [3-5], pulmonary fibrosis [6,7] and AIDS [8,9]. Induction of CXCL8 has been suggested to be mediated through NF-kappaB in cooperation with AP-1 [10,11], however the precise mechanism is not fully elucidated, and treatment strategies aimed at inhibiting CXCL8 have failed [12]. Persistent production of IL-6 and CXCL8 leads to chronic inflammation and enhanced survival of lymphocytes increasing serum cytokine/chemokine levels. This forms the basis of several autoimmune disorders including plasmacytosis and hyperplasia [13]. To develop viable CXCL8 based treatment strategies, it is necessary to identify the signalling pathways regulating CXCL8 and determine how this is coupled to NF-kappaB, AP-1 and IL-6.\nThe signalling pathways leading to NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation are overlapping, where both are involved in the induction and regulation of cytokines/chemokines. NF-kappaB is activated in response to stress, such as oxidative stress, bacterial toxins, viruses and UV light [14], and is essential for differentiation, proliferation and survival of many cell types including T-lymphocytes [15]. AP-1 activation requires Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2) and Jun (c-Jun, v-Jun, JunB, JunD) through the formation of homo- and hetero-dimers [16,17], and regulates transcription of a broad range of genes involved in immune responses [18-21]. Both AP-1 and NF-kappaB binding sites have been identified in the promoter region of IL-6 and CXCL8 [12,22], however, the mechanism by which these interleukins are regulated in T-cells is still not clear. CXCL8 is a C-X-C chemokine with properties enabling it to recruit T-cells and basophils and to activate neutrophils and monocytes [23]. IL-6 is a cytokine that possesses both pro- and anti-inflammatory characteristics and that plays a key role in haematopoiesis and acute-phase responses [24,25].\nThe present study suggests that the regulation of CXCL8 and IL-6 is uncoupled. Using Jurkat T-cells exposed to PMA and heat killed (HK) Escherichia coli MG1655 in combination with inhibitors of NF-kappaB, JNK and PKC, we demonstrated that NF-kappaB regulates IL-6 expression while the regulation of CXCL8 more closely correlated to AP-1 activity. These results indicate that inhibition of NF-kappaB is not an effective strategy in countering the high CXCL8 activities in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, AIDS and pulmonary fibrosis.","catanns":[{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":123,"end":130},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":148,"end":170},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":182,"end":186},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":188,"end":192},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":202,"end":207},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":411,"end":415},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":420,"end":425},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":544,"end":553},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":557,"end":562},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":588,"end":596},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":738,"end":748},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":749,"end":754},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":784,"end":794},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":798,"end":802},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":807,"end":812},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1041,"end":1046},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1127,"end":1137},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1143},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1201,"end":1205},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1626,"end":1629},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1631,"end":1636},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1638,"end":1642},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1644,"end":1649},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1651,"end":1656},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1662,"end":1665},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1667,"end":1672},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1674,"end":1679},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1681,"end":1685},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1687,"end":1691},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1705,"end":1741},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1928,"end":1932},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1937,"end":1942},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1984,"end":2002},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":2007,"end":2016},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2048,"end":2053},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2184,"end":2188},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":2381,"end":2391},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2395,"end":2400},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2405,"end":2409},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":2594,"end":2603},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2604,"end":2608},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":2609,"end":2619},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":2630,"end":2640},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2644,"end":2649},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2677,"end":2681},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":2776,"end":2786},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2796,"end":2801},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T35"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T35"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T35"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T36"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T37"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T38"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E18","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E19","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E20","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E21","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E22","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E23","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E24","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E25","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E26","type":"instanceOf","object":"T42"},{"id":"E27","type":"instanceOf","object":"T42"},{"id":"E28","type":"instanceOf","object":"T43"},{"id":"E29","type":"instanceOf","object":"T43"},{"id":"E30","type":"instanceOf","object":"T44"},{"id":"E31","type":"instanceOf","object":"T45"},{"id":"E32","type":"instanceOf","object":"T46"},{"id":"E33","type":"instanceOf","object":"T47"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T31","object":"T1"},{"id":"R2","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T31","object":"T2"},{"id":"R3","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T31
