FLAG-tagged mouse HOIP cDNA was inserted into the multiple cloning site of pMIP. A pMIP construct encoding mouse IKKgamma with an amino terminal birch profilin peptide (BP)-tag was also prepared. Retroviral particles were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells with pMIP, pMIP-HOIP, or pMIP-IKKgamma and the packaging vector pCL-Eco [32]. Two days after transfection, culture supernatants were harvested and filtered. A20.2J or HOIP-deficient cells were added to 24-well plates (2.5x105 cells/well) with 1 ml virus-containing supernatant and 8 microg/ml polybrene. Plates were centrifuged at 500 x g for 2 hrs at room temperature. Cells were cultured in B cell culture medium for 48 hrs, after which the transduced cells were selected in 3 microg/ml puromycin.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":102,"end":106},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":111,"end":119},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":310,"end":314},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":405,"end":413},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":580,"end":584},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":594,"end":602},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":731,"end":735},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":736,"end":745},"category":"Negative_regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E1"}]}
