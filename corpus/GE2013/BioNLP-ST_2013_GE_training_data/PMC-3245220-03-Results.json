In addition, because of the number of conventional PKCs existing within mononuclear cells, pharmacological inhibitors of PKC family activation was used to determine the relationship of PKC activation to M-CSF-induced cellular survival. MDMs were transfected with the pNF-kappaB-SEAP reporter and then treated with the general PKC inhibitor, Ro-31-8220; the conventional PKCalpha/beta inhibitor Go-6976; or the intracellular calcium blocker BAPTA/AM. Ro-31-8220 significantly suppressed M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB activity compared to cells treated with M-CSF alone (Figure 2A). In addition, Go-6976 and BAPTA/AM also blocked NF-kappaB activity in M-CSF-treated MDMs. Trypan blue exclusion analysis did not indicate cell death suggesting that this suppression was not due to non-specific toxicity. These data indicate that M-CSF mediated NF-kappaB activation through calcium-dependent conventional PKC activation.\nWe next investigated whether PKC inhibition affected NF-kappaB activity in the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Similar to MDMs, PKC inhibitors Ro-31-8220, Go-6976 and BAPTA/AM reduced M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB activity in a dose-dependent manner in RAW 264.7 macrophages (Figure 2B). To ensure that PKC specifically regulated NF-kappaB p65 and not the closely related family member, c-Rel, we co-transfected c-Rel and NF-kappaB-SEAP constructs into the Raw 264.7 cell line and measured NF-kappaB activity in response to M-CSF. There was no increased NF-kappaB activity in cells expressing c-Rel (Figure S1). These observations indicate that PKC functioned upstream of NF-kappaB p65 in MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":697,"end":705},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":706,"end":710},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":711,"end":720},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1558,"end":1567},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1578,"end":1581},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1625,"end":1630},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1820,"end":1830},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1831,"end":1836},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1897},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1920,"end":1923},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E6"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E4"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E4"}]}
