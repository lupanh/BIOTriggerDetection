RNA was isolated from the cells, reverse-transcribed, and then subjected to quantitative PCR to determine levels of GLepsilon transcripts. Results were normalized to the levels of Hprt1 transcripts in each sample. Symbols indicate the values from duplicate cultures (a line indicates the mean of the two values). Similar results were obtained in a second experiment and in an additional experiment with a second HOIP-deficient clone.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":9},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":10,"end":23},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":27,"end":36},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":40,"end":44},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":56,"end":60},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":61,"end":70},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":89,"end":93},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":94,"end":103},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":172,"end":176},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":206,"end":210},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":211,"end":220},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":245,"end":249},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":271,"end":275},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":281,"end":285},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":390,"end":394},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":512,"end":521},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":522,"end":533},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":576,"end":581},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":582,"end":593},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":808,"end":812},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":813,"end":822},"category":"Negative_regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E8"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E6"}]}
