Total RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA. Real-time RT PCR was performed using primers for IkappaBalpha, BCL-xl or GAPDH. Data are expressed as relative fold increase of IkappaBalpha or BCL-xl gene expression upon treatment over non-stimulated cells. Data represent the mean +/- S.E.M for three independent experiments.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":357,"end":369},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":371,"end":377},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":424,"end":432},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":436,"end":448},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":452,"end":458},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":464,"end":474},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E4"}]}
