Briefly, total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) according to manufacturer's guidelines, and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using TaqMan Gold RT-PCR Kit using random hexamer primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States). Foxp3 and HTLV-I Tax mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR using ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The normalized values in each sample were calculated as the relative quantity of Foxp3 or HTLV-I Tax mRNA expression divided by the relative quantity of HPRT mRNA expression. The values were calculated by the following formula: normalized Foxp3 or HTLV-I Tax expression = 2Ct value of HPRT - Ct value of Foxp3 or HTLV-I Tax.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":17,"end":20},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":21,"end":31},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":91,"end":96},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":108,"end":111},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":112,"end":122},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":484,"end":489},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":501,"end":504},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":505,"end":520},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":703,"end":708},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":719,"end":722},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":723,"end":738},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":775,"end":779},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":780,"end":795},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":861,"end":866},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":877,"end":880},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":881,"end":891},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":907,"end":911},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":926,"end":931},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":942,"end":945},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E9"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E10"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E11"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M4","type":"Speculation","object":"E4"},{"id":"M5","type":"Speculation","object":"E5"},{"id":"M6","type":"Speculation","object":"E6"},{"id":"M7","type":"Speculation","object":"E7"},{"id":"M8","type":"Speculation","object":"E8"},{"id":"M9","type":"Speculation","object":"E9"},{"id":"M10","type":"Speculation","object":"E10"},{"id":"M11","type":"Speculation","object":"E11"}]}
