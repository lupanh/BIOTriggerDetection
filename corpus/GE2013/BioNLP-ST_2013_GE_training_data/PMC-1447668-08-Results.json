Phosphorylation of serine 133 does not, however, affect the DNA-binding activity of CREB in most cases [39-41]. Addition of forskolin to HEK 293T cells stimulated activation of a CREB reporter vector about 65 fold (Figure 7A). Overexpression of Foxp3 was capable of down-regulating forskolin-induced CREB transcriptional activation. The functional interaction between Foxp3 and CREB did not affect the DNA-binding activity of CREB-1, but did show a modest decrease in activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) DNA-binding activity in the presence of forskolin as determined by transcription factor ELISA (Figure 7B).\nWhile Foxp3 has been shown to bind to and repress activation of both NF-kappaB and NF-AT, exactly how Foxp3 functions to bring about this affect has not been elucidated. To determine how Foxp3 blocks CREB-dependent transcription, we examined whether Foxp3 was capable of (1) disrupting the recruitment of coactivator proteins and/or (2) preventing phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 (which is a prerequisite for coactivator recruitment). Since both of these events are required for CREB-dependent gene expression, we hypothesized that Foxp3 may affect CREB activation at both steps. To determine whether Foxp3 can disrupt the function/recruitment of the coactivator protein p300, we introduced a Gal4 reporter vector and a Gal4-BD-CREB-1 expression vector into HEK 293T cells in the absence or presence of Foxp3, p300, and/or control expression vectors (Figure 7C). As expected, p300 overexpression stimulated transcription of the Gal4-BD-CREB-1 fusion protein. Foxp3, again, repressed basal levels of Gal4-BD-CREB-1 activation by more than 2-fold, while effectively neutralizing Gal4-BD-CREB-1 activation in the presence of p300. We next analyzed the effect of Foxp3 on phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 in forskolin-treated HEK 293T cells by Western blot analysis. Overexpression of Foxp3 failed to reduce the detectable levels of CREB phosphorylation using a phosphospecific antibody for CREB-1 (unpublished data). However, when we attempted to determine whether Foxp3 could physically interact with the coactivator protein p300, we found that p300 immunoprecipitated Foxp3 when both proteins were overexpressed in HEK 293T cells (Figure 7D). Collectively, these results suggest that Foxp3 antagonizes CREB-dependent gene expression by directly interacting with coactivator p300 and interfering with its function and/or recruitment to CREB-responsive promoter sequences.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":331,"end":338},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":339,"end":346},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":379,"end":382},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":383,"end":387},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":640,"end":654},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":658,"end":663},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":761,"end":772},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":781,"end":786},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":804,"end":810},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":819,"end":826},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":839,"end":845},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":869,"end":877},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":881,"end":914},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":916,"end":921},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":927,"end":934},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1036,"end":1041},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1060,"end":1064},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1132,"end":1137},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1222},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1280,"end":1285},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1568,"end":1573},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1637,"end":1642},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1707,"end":1711},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1729,"end":1733},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1756,"end":1770},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":1771,"end":1781},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1839,"end":1844},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1846,"end":1850},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":1867,"end":1877},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1912,"end":1916},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":1917,"end":1931},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":1932,"end":1942},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":1943,"end":1956},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1964,"end":1978},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1995,"end":2000},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":2009,"end":2018},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2035,"end":2049},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":2050,"end":2060},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":2100,"end":2112},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2113,"end":2127},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":2128,"end":2138},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2158,"end":2162},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2195,"end":2200},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":2304,"end":2318},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2322,"end":2327},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2428,"end":2434},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2503,"end":2508},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":2526,"end":2534},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2564,"end":2568},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2584,"end":2588},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":2589,"end":2607},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2608,"end":2613},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":2614,"end":2618},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2619,"end":2632},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":2638,"end":2651},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2724,"end":2729},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":2785,"end":2796},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2814,"end":2818},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":2823,"end":2834},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2840,"end":2843},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":2860,"end":2871},"category":"Binding"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T37"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T38"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T37"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T38"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T42"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T43"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T44"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T45"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T46"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T47"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T47"},{"id":"E15","t
