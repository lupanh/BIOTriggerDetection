Among the IkappaB molecules, IkappaBalpha is highly induced by NF-kappaB activation [40]. Having shown that PKC regulated NF-kappaB activity in M-CSF-stimulated MDMs, we next determined whether inhibition of PKC activity decreased expression of NF-kappaB-regulated genes. We treated both MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes and then stimulated with M-CSF. IkappaBalpha gene was measured by qRT-PCR. As shown in Figures 6A and 6B, M-CSF enhanced IkappaBalpha gene expression and PKC inhibition by Ro-31-8220 decreased IkappaBalpha gene expression in both MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells (p<0.01), demonstrating that PKC affected NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression in macrophages.\nTo further define the role of PKC in mediating human MDM survival in response to M-CSF, we examined the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-xL, which is also regulated by NF-kappaB. As shown in Figure 6C, Ro-31-8220 reduced M-CSF-stimulated BCL-xL expression compared to cells treated with M-CSF and the vehicle control DMSO (p<0.05).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":162,"end":174},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":185,"end":192},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":527,"end":539},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":607,"end":615},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":616,"end":628},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":634,"end":644},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":678,"end":687},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":688,"end":700},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":706,"end":716},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":948,"end":958},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":962,"end":985},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":986,"end":992},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":994,"end":999},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1008,"end":1017},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1073},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1090},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1091,"end":1097},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1108},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T7","object":"T5"},{"id":"R2","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T8","object":"T5"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E5"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E6"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E7"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"E10","object":"E9"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E10"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E6"}]}
