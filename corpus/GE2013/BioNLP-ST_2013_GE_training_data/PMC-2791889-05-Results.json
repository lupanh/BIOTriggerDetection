For this, CD4+ T cells were differentiated for 2 consecutive weeks with high antigen doses in the presence or absence of IL-12 throughout (Figures 4A-4D). High antigen dose and IL-12 cooperated to induce maximal IL-10 production (Figures 4A and 4B), given that this combination resulted in the highest numbers of IL-10-producing Th1 cells. Repeated high antigen dose stimulation in the absence of exogenously added IL-12 resulted in the production of IL-10 by Th1 cells, suggesting that repeated strong TCR triggering may overcome the need for IL-12 for IL-10 induction (Figures 4C and 4D). However, IL-10 induction under these conditions was abrogated when IL-12p40-deficient DCs were used as APCs (Figure 4E). Thus, IL-12 is essential during both primary and secondary antigenic stimulation for production of IL-10 by Th1 cells.\nTo determine the requirements for stability of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we differentiated CD4+ T cells for 1 week with high antigen doses with or without IL-12 (Figures 4A and 4C), washed them, and then restimulated them for an additional week with a low antigen dose, in the absence or presence of IL-12 (Figure 4F). Th1 cells induced in the first week to produce IL-10 by culture with high antigen doses and IL-12 lost their ability to express IL-10 when recultured with low doses of OVA, which could be compensated for, to some extent, by addition of IL-12 to the secondary cultures (Figure 4F), again suggesting that antigen dose and IL-12 signals cooperate for the induction of IL-10. Finally, DO11.10 CD4+ cells that were exposed to low doses of antigen and IL-12 during the primary differentiation phase produced high amounts of IFN-gamma but little IL-10, but they could be induced to produce IL-10 when both high antigen dose and IL-12 were present during the recall phase (Figure S4). Thus, high antigen dose and IL-12 are required for sustaining the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":6,"end":16},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":20,"end":30},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":63,"end":68},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":158,"end":163},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":172,"end":177},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":195,"end":204},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":208,"end":213},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":238,"end":241},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":349,"end":354},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":405,"end":410},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":425,"end":431},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":440,"end":445},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":446,"end":456},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":541,"end":546},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":547,"end":556},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":643,"end":648},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":649,"end":657},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":665,"end":675},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":679,"end":684},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":763,"end":767},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":772,"end":777},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":782,"end":787},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":788,"end":797},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":828,"end":833},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":834,"end":843},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":871,"end":880},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":886,"end":894},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":895,"end":904},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":946,"end":951},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":955,"end":964},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":1025,"end":1035},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1039,"end":1044},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1110,"end":1115},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":1116,"end":1125},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1155,"end":1158},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1219,"end":1224},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1364,"end":1369},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":1393,"end":1400},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":1422,"end":1429},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1430,"end":1435},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1475,"end":1480},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":1481,"end":1485},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":1503,"end":1510},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1511,"end":1516},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1551,"end":1554},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":1571,"end":1582},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":1607,"end":1615},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1619,"end":1624},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1703,"end":1708},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":1717,"end":1726},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":1735,"end":1744},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1748,"end":1753},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1772,"end":1775},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1829,"end":1834},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":1876,"end":1884},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1901,"end":1910},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1922,"end":1927},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":1947,"end":1954},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":1958,"end":1965},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1966,"end":1971},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2004,"end":2009},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2088,"end":2093},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":2126,"end":2135},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2139,"end":2144},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":2145,"end":2155},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T38"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T42"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T43"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T44"},
