To confirm the role of PKC and p65 Ser276 phosphorylation on NF-kappaB activity, we co-transfected the NF-kappaB-SEAP construct with either WT NF-kappaB p65 or NF-kappaB p65 276S/A constructs in Raw 264.7 cells, then treated cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 in the absence or presences of M-CSF. As expected in cells transfected with vector control, inhibiting PKC reduced M-CSF-stimulated NF-kappaB activity compared to cells treated with M-CSF and the vehicle DMSO (p = 0.001) (Figure 8A). In contrast, expressing WT NF-kappaB p65 (p65 WT) increased NF-kappaB activity, while the general PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 decreased this NF-kappaB activity (p = 0.001). Notably, the introduction of NF-kappaB p65 276 S/A construct significantly reduced NF-kappaB activity compared with the WT NF-kappaB p65 construct (p = 0.005) and M-CSF treatment was unable to overcome this inhibition.\nFurthermore, we co-transfected the NF-kappaB-SEAP construct along with either the WT NF-kappaB p65, NF-kappaB p65 276S/A or NF-kappaB p65 536S/A constructs into a NF-kappaB p65-/- murine fibroblast cell line and measured NF-kappaB activity. As predicted, expression of WT NF-kappaB p65 (p65 WT) in NF-kappaB p65-/- cell line constitutively activated NF-kappaB compared to cells transfected with vector control without any stimulation (Figure 8B). In comparison, transfecting the NF-kappaB p65 276S/A construct reduced NF-kappaB activity by 5-fold (p = 0.006, WT NF-kappaB p65 vs. NF-kappaB p65 276S/A), while expressing the NF-kappaB p65 536S/A construct increased NF-kappaB activity in the p65-/- cells to levels similar to WT NF-kappaB p65 transfected cells.\nSince M-CSF-induced PKC activation regulated NF-kappaB activity via Ser276 residue of NF-kappaB p65 in primary human MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells, we next examined if this occurred in NF-kappaB p65-/- fibroblasts in response to a native stimulus for these cells, TNFalpha. NF-kappaB activity was measured in the WT NF-kappaB p65 or NF-kappaB p65 276S/A transfected cells treated with TNFalpha in the absence or presence of Ro-31-8220 (Figure 8C). As expected, TNFalpha increased NF-kappaB activity in NF-kappaB p65-/- cells expressing WT p65 and (p = 0.001) PKC inhibitors decreased NF-kappaB activity to the non-stimulated (NS) level (p = 0.007). Introducing NF-kappaB p65 276 S/A constructs significantly reduced NF-kappaB activity compared with the WT NF-kappaB p65 construct (p = 0.001). Notably, TNFalpha failed to increase NF-kappaB activity in the NF-kappaB p65-/- cells expressing NF-kappaB p65 276S/A constructs. These observations are similar to macrophages overexpressing the NF-kappaB p65 276S/A (Figure 8A). Our data demonstrate that Ser276 of NF-kappaB p65 is essential in regulating NF-kappaB activity and suggests that PKC regulates NF-kappaB activity by modulating the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 at Ser276 residue.","catanns":[{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":79,"end":90},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":101,"end":104},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":105,"end":120},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":124,"end":130},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":139,"end":145},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":178,"end":181},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":182,"end":188},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":189,"end":204},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":231,"end":245},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":300,"end":303},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":317,"end":320},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":659,"end":669},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":683,"end":686},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":688,"end":691},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":829,"end":841},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":855,"end":858},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":949,"end":952},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":1051,"end":1065},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1130,"end":1133},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1145,"end":1148},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1169,"end":1172},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1208,"end":1211},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":1211,"end":1214},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":1290,"end":1300},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1317,"end":1320},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1322,"end":1325},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1343,"end":1346},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":1346,"end":1349},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":1497,"end":1509},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1524,"end":1527},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1607,"end":1610},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1625,"end":1628},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":1644,"end":1654},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1669,"end":1672},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1726,"end":1729},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":1729,"end":1732},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1773,"end":1776},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":1777,"end":1788},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1892,"end":1895},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1986,"end":1989},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":1989,"end":1992},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2055,"end":2063},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2117,"end":2120},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2134,"end":2137},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":2145,"end":2156},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2176,"end":2184},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2252,"end":2260},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2303,"end":2306},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":2306,"end":2309},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":2316,"end":2326},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2330,"end":2333},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":2440,"end":2451},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2462,"end":2465},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2557,"end":2560},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2593,"end":2601},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2657,"end":2660},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":2660,"end":2663},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":2670,"end":2680},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2691,"end":2694},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":2760,"end":2774},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2789,"end":2792},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2859,"end":2862},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":2963,"end":2973},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":2978,"end":2993},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":3007,"end":3010},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":3014,"end":3020},"category":"Entity"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T44"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T45"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T45"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T46"},{"id":"E9","type":"instance
