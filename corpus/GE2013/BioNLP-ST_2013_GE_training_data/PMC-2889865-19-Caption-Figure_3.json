Jurkat T-cells were either treated with media (white bars) or stimulated with PMA (black bars) and incubated for 1 h, 2 h, 6 h and 24 h. Aged media was added following each centrifugation step representative to the stimulation time (see Materials and methods). Cytokine levels (A) CXCL8, (B) IL-6 and (C) TNF were detected by ELISA. Statistical significance from the control was determined using Student's t-test.
