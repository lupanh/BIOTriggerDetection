DNA was extracted from 1 x 106 cells using Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States), and 100 ng of the sample DNA solution was analyzed by this system. The HTLV-I proviral DNA load was calculated by the following formula: copy number of HTLV-I (pX) per 100 cells = (copy number of pX)/(copy number of beta-actin/2) x 100.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":49,"end":52},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":450,"end":460},"category":"Protein"}]}
