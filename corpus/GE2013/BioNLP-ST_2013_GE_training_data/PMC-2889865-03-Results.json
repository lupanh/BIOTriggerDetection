The cytokine profile revealed an enhanced induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-6, TNF and the chemokine CXCL8. The levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were unaffected by PMA but were significantly decreased by HK E. coli (Table 1). These results confirmed that PMA and HK E. coli induced an inflammatory response in the Jurkat T-cells. It is interesting to note that PMA was 120-fold more effective at inducing CXCL8 than HK E. coli. PMA-dependent induction of AP-1 and down-regulation of NF-kappaB suggests an involvement of AP-1 in CXCL8 regulation. Determination of the time course of cytokine induction in response to PMA showed that CXCL8 was already released between 2-6 h, while TNF and IL-6 were released between 6-24 h (figure 3). These results indicated that the cytokines were differentially regulated and that the release was not associated with the early transient induction of NF-kappaB. The temporal induction of AP-1 correlated to the CXCL8 levels and preceded the TNF and IL-6 release. This suggests an association between CXCL8 release and AP-1 signalling.","catanns":[{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":231,"end":239},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":240,"end":249},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":284,"end":288},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":290,"end":294},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":318,"end":323},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":370,"end":375},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":381,"end":391},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":422,"end":431},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":614,"end":623},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":627,"end":635},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":636,"end":641},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":736,"end":747},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":759,"end":764},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":765,"end":775},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":863,"end":868},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":881,"end":889},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":919,"end":923},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":929,"end":937},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":994,"end":1007},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1028,"end":1037},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1176,"end":1181},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1214,"end":1218},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1219,"end":1226},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1265,"end":1270},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1271,"end":1278},"category":"Localization"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T12","object":"T7"},{"id":"R2","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T12","object":"T8"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E4"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E6"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E8"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E9"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E10"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E11"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E12"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E13"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E14"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E7"}]}
