The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this inflammatory phenotype remain elusive. Dendritic cells may contribute to the initiation and progression of the phenotype of SHARPIN-deficient mice because of their pivotal role in innate and adaptive immunity. Here we show by flow cytometry that SHARPIN- deficiency did not alter the distribution of different DC subtypes in the spleen. In response to TOLL-like receptor (TLR) agonists LPS and poly I:C, cultured bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from WT and mutant mice exhibited similar increases in expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86. However, stimulated SHARPIN-deficient BMDC had reduced transcription and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators IL6, IL12P70, GMCSF, and nitric oxide. Mutant BMDC had defective activation of NF-kappaB signaling, whereas the MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and MAPK11/12/13/14 (p38 MAP kinase isoforms) and TBK1 signaling pathways were intact. A mixed lymphocyte reaction showed that mutant BMDC only induced a weak Th1 immune response but stimulated increased Th2 cytokine production from allogeneic naive CD4+ T cells. In conclusion, loss of Sharpin in mice significantly affects the immune function of DC and this may partially account for the systemic inflammation and Th2-biased immune response.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":7},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":135,"end":144},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":152,"end":159},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":161,"end":207},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":224,"end":230},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":232,"end":237},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":585,"end":592},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":593,"end":602},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":707,"end":714},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":716,"end":726},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1011,"end":1015},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1021},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1027,"end":1031},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1053,"end":1060},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1061,"end":1070},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1087},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1088,"end":1101},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1106,"end":1115},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1146,"end":1149},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1160,"end":1165},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1258,"end":1263},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1264,"end":1265},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1267,"end":1271},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1272,"end":1273},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1279,"end":1285},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1286,"end":1288},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1289,"end":1291},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1292,"end":1294},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1325,"end":1329},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1554,"end":1558},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1562,"end":1569},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T3","object":"T2"},{"id":"R2","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T5","object":"T2"},{"id":"R3","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T4","object":"T2"},{"id":"R4","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T16","object":"T14"},{"id":"R5","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T17","object":"T15"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E2"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E3"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E4"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R11","type":"causeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E5"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R13","type":"causeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E7"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"E10","object":"E9"},{"id":"R15","type":"causeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E9"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E11"},{"id":"R17","type":"causeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E11"},{"id":"R18","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E6"},{"id":"R19","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E8"},{"id":"R20","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E10"},{"id":"R21","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E12"},{"id":"R22","type":"themeOf","subject":"T23","object":"E13"}]}
