The addition PTX to LPS-stimulated cells resulted in a reduction in TNF-alpha, similar to that observed in our previous experiments (529 pg/mL +/- 112 vs. 37 pg/mL +/- 10; P < 0.01). Pre-incubation of cells with H89 prior to LPS and PTX exposure did not result in any significant modulation of TNF-alpha production when compared to that demonstrated with PTX alone (P = 0.2; Figure 5). These results suggest that downregulation of TNF-alpha production by PTX in LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells is, at least in part, PKA-independent.","catanns":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":17,"end":26},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":27,"end":37},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":38,"end":56},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":76,"end":80},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":95,"end":102},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":103,"end":117},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":121,"end":130},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":131,"end":141},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":320,"end":328},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":334,"end":343},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":347,"end":356},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":533,"end":539},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":559,"end":569},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":573,"end":582},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":583,"end":593},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":692,"end":706},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":710,"end":719},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":720,"end":730},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":800,"end":811},"category":"Regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E1","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E9"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"E11","object":"E10"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E11"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E12"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"E14","object":"E13"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E14"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"E13","object":"E15"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E10"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E15"}]}
