{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"1310901","division_id":11,"section":"RESULTS","text":"Methylation-sensitive enzymes do not cut specific sites in the IRF-4 promoter in hematopoietic cells\nTo further investigate promoter methylation as a regulatory mechanism of IRF-4 gene expression, restriction-PCR-assays were performed (20,24), where only methylated DNA would not be cut enabling subsequent PCR amplification and vice versa. Genomic DNA from leukemic cells Jurkat, CML-T1, U-937, K-562, EM-2 and BV-173 was digested with the methylation-sensitive enzymes HpaII, Bsh1236I and HaeII-isochizomer Bsp143II. EcoRI, which has no recognition site within the IRF-4 promoter, and the methylation-resistant enzyme MspI served as controls. Two separate amplification reactions were performed, generating two fragments, F1 and F2 (Figure 3A). After digestion with HpaII and Bsp143II a sufficient PCR amplification of F1 and F2 was detected in DNA from IRF-4-negative Jurkat, CML-T1, U-937, K-562 and EM-2 cells, suggesting a promoter methylation (and restriction protection) at the respective recognition sites (Figure 3B and C). Notably, in IRF-4-positive SD-1 cells digestion with the methylation-sensitive enzymes completely inhibited amplification of F1 and F2. In IRF-4-positive BV-173 cells a HpaII, but not a Bsh1236I digestion, significantly reduced the amplifiable DNA message of F2 (Figure 3C), whereas amplification of F1 was not affected (Figure 3B). This implied that IRF-4 transcription in SD-1 and BV-173 cells is associated with less promoter methylation (in BV-173 especially at HpaII sites) as compared with the tested IRF-4-negative cells.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":63,"end":68},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":174,"end":179},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":185,"end":195},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":567,"end":572},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":856,"end":861},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":862,"end":870},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1051},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1052,"end":1060},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1173,"end":1178},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1179,"end":1187},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1385,"end":1390},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1391,"end":1404},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1541,"end":1546},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1547,"end":1555},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E6"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E6"}]}
