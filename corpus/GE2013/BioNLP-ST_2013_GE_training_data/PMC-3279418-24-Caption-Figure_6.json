At 0, 15, 30, and 60 minutes, whole-cell lysates were obtained and subject to immunoblots with antibodies against proteins involved in NF-kappaB, TBK1/IRF3, ERK1/2, and p38 signaling pathways. Beta-actin was used as loading control. (C) Cellular levels of p-IKK1/2 and p-IkappaBalpha in LPS- or poly I:C-stimulated BMDC were quantitated with ImageJ (NIH) and presented as trend lines. Results are representative of at least two independent experiments.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":320,"end":324},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":325,"end":329},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":331,"end":335},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":336,"end":337},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":367,"end":377},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":432,"end":436},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":437,"end":438},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":445,"end":457},"category":"Protein"}]}
