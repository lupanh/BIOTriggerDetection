It follows that HOIP is likely a key mediator of CD40 signaling. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated A20.2J and HOIP-deficient cells with CD154 (CD40 ligand) expressed by HI5 insect cells [7], [8] and measured activation of the NF-kappaB and JNK pathways, two of the major transcriptional regulators activated by CD40 [4]. Cell-associated CD154 was used as the stimulus in these experiments as it typically provides more robust, and therefore more readily detected, activation signals than does anti-CD40 antibody. Activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway is initiated with the phosphorylation of IkappaB proteins by the IkappaB kinase complex (IKK). In resting cells, IkappaB proteins are responsible for sequestering NF-kappaB subunits in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation by the IKK complex targets IkappaB proteins for ubiquitination and degradation, allowing NF-kappaB to enter the nucleus and activate gene expression. CD40-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha in HOIP-deficient cells was dramatically impaired relative to that observed in parental A20.2J cells (Fig. 4). We also assayed activation of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK in response to CD40 engagement (Fig. 4). CD40-mediated JNK activation in HOIP-deficient cells was impaired as measured by phosphorylation of Thr183 and Tyr185 in JNK. CD40-induced activation of NF-kappaB and JNK in HOIP-reconstituted cells was normal, demonstrating that the defects observed in gene-deficient cells were due to the absence of HOIP expression.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":18},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":97,"end":101},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":129,"end":133},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":190,"end":194},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":223,"end":227},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":315,"end":320},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":322,"end":333},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":335,"end":344},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":490,"end":494},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":505,"end":515},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":516,"end":521},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":872,"end":883},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":888,"end":900},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":901,"end":919},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1104,"end":1108},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1109,"end":1117},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1118,"end":1133},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1149},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1153,"end":1165},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1169,"end":1173},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1174,"end":1183},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1207,"end":1215},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1362,"end":1366},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1367,"end":1377},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1388,"end":1392},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1420,"end":1424},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1425,"end":1434},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1514,"end":1518},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1562,"end":1566},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1567,"end":1580},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1690,"end":1694},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1695,"end":1705},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T8","object":"T7"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E1"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"causeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E5"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R9","type":"causeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E7"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E6"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E8"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T14","object":"E9"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E10"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E11"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E12"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E13"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"T19","object":"E14"},{"id":"R18","type":"themeOf","subject":"T20","object":"E15"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E15"}]}
