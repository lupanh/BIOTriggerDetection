Briefly, 1x106 cells were stimulated overnight with anti-CD40 antibody (10 microg/ml) or an isotype control antibody, with or without 500 U/ml mouse IL-4 (BD Biosciences). RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and reverse-transcribed (Superscript III kit, Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR for GLepsilon and Hprt1 was performed using SYBR GREEN master mix (Applied Biosystems), and an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR instrument. Expression of GLepsilon in each sample was normalized to the expression of Hprt1.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":9},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":31,"end":35},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":36,"end":45},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":46,"end":56},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":60,"end":69},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":70,"end":83},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":276,"end":280},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":423,"end":432},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":437,"end":442},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":571,"end":581},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":585,"end":594},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":632,"end":642},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":646,"end":651},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"causeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E5"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"}]}
