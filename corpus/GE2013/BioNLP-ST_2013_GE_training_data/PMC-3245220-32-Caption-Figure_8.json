The cells were transfected for 18-24 hours, serum starved for 4 hours, and then incubated with 10 microM of Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes prior to treatment with 100 ng/ml of M-CSF for 2 hours and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. (B) NF-kappaB p65-/- cell line was transiently transfected with pNF-kappaB-SEAP along with empty vector or plasmid encoding either NF-kappaB p65 WT, NF-kappaB p65 276S/A, or NF-kappaB p65 536S/A. The cells were cultured for 24 hours and then serum starved for 4 hours. Cells were then incubated in fresh DMEM medium for 2 hours and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. The results shown are fold change over empty vector + pTAL-SEAP. (C) NF-kappaB p65-/- cell line was transiently transfected with pNF-kappaB-SEAP with either empty vector or plasmid encoding either NF-kappaB p65 WT or NF-kappaB p65 276S/A. The cells were transfected for 24 hours and serum starved for 4 hours, and then incubated with 10 microM of Ro-31-8220 for 30 minutes prior to treatment with 10 ng/ml of TNFalpha. The supernatant were collected after 2 hours of treatment and SEAP secretion in the medium was measured. The results shown are the fold change over empty vector + pNF-kappaB-SEAP. Data shown are mean +/- S.E.M for at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":13},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":108,"end":119},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":202,"end":205},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":222,"end":225},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":484,"end":487},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":517,"end":528},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":611,"end":614},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":629,"end":632},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":654,"end":657},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":924,"end":927},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":957,"end":968},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1052,"end":1055},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1072,"end":1075},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1254,"end":1262},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E7"}]}
