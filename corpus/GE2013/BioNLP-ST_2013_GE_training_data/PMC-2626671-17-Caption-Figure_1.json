(A) Kinetics of Prf1, Gzmb, Tbx21 (T-bet), and Eomes mRNA expression in differentiating P14 CD8+ T cells analyzed by Northern blotting. RNA from day 7 Th1 cells was used as a control. Sizes of mRNA transcripts are indicated. (B) Quantification of relative mRNA amounts by phosphorimager analysis. (C) Kinetics of protein expression in differentiating P14 CD8+ T cells analyzed by immunoblotting. Sizes of protein bands are indicated. (D) Relative protein amounts quantified from the Western blots. (E) Intracellular staining for granzyme B, IFN-gamma, and TNF. Granzyme B staining was specific relative to an isotype control (not depicted). Cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 h. (F) FACS-based assay to measure cytolytic activity of P14 CD8+ T cells against EL4 targets loaded with 0 (-) or 1 (+) muM Gp33 peptide (effector-to-target ratio = 5:1). Percentage of Annexin V+ (apoptotic) target cells in the CD8-negative EL4 target population (dot plots) was determined (histograms). Cytolytic activity was blocked by incubation with 2 mM EGTA (not depicted), confirming involvement of the granule exocytosis (perforin-granzyme B) pathway. Data are representative of at least five (A-E) or three (F) independent experiments.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":38},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":80,"end":84},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":86,"end":90},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":92,"end":97},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":99,"end":104},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":111,"end":116},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":117,"end":132},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":156,"end":159},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":419,"end":422},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":580,"end":588},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":593,"end":603},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":605,"end":614},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":620,"end":623},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":625,"end":635},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":636,"end":644},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":819,"end":822},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":944,"end":953},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":987,"end":990},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1189,"end":1197},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1198,"end":1208},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T5","object":"T4"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E6"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E7"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E8"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M4","type":"Speculation","object":"E4"},{"id":"M5","type":"Speculation","object":"E5"},{"id":"M6","type":"Speculation","object":"E6"},{"id":"M7","type":"Speculation","object":"E7"},{"id":"M8","type":"Speculation","object":"E8"}]}
