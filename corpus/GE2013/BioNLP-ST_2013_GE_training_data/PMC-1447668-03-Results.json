Unlike full-length Foxp3, which localizes almost exclusively to the nucleus and can bind in a sequence-specific manner to forkhead binding sites, the deltaFKH mutant fails to localize to the nucleus and thus cannot interact with promoter elements or nuclear proteins [16]. Therefore, we utilized the deltaFKH mutant to determine whether nuclear localization (or other function associated with the FKH domain) of Foxp3 was a prerequisite for inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Although Foxp3 interaction with NF-kappaB presumably takes place in the nucleus, it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus. Overexpression of full-length Foxp3, but not of deltaFKH, was able to suppress activation of a cotransfected NF-kappaB reporter vector in HEK 293T cells (Figure 2B). Both Foxp3 and deltaFKH were expressed at very high levels following transfection as detected by real-time RT-PCR (unpublished data). These data appear to suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain is critically important for Foxp3 to down-regulate NF-kappaB-dependent transcription. However, NF-kappaB activation was blocked to a similar extent by both full-length Foxp3 and deltaFKH in Jurkat T cells (Figure 2C) and primary human CD4+ T cells (Figure 2D). Western blot analysis of NF-kappaB p65 expression demonstrated that Foxp3 and deltaFKH does not block NF-kappaB activation at the level of p65 protein expression (Figure 2E). These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function, because they suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and possibly nuclear localization, are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations. Alternative interpretations may include the possibility that the localization of deltaFKH differ between epithelial cells and T cells. In either case, these results suggest a cell type-specific mechanism of action for this Foxp3 mutant.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":130,"end":135},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":225,"end":230},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":231,"end":238},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":243,"end":253},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":301,"end":306},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":329,"end":334},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":401,"end":406},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":408,"end":413},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":414,"end":423},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":450,"end":457},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":466,"end":470},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":532,"end":547},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":557,"end":565},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":573,"end":580},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":597,"end":605},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":682,"end":697},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":719,"end":726},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":727,"end":739},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":794,"end":799},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":868,"end":873},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":874,"end":885},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":982,"end":987},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":999,"end":1003},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1038,"end":1045},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1058},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1073},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":1074,"end":1083},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":1108,"end":1122},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1143},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1164},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1279,"end":1284},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1289,"end":1297},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1303,"end":1312},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":1333,"end":1342},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1503,"end":1508},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1643,"end":1648},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1653,"end":1661},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1710,"end":1713},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1771,"end":1774},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":1775,"end":1785},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1804,"end":1809},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1814,"end":1822},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":1832,"end":1837},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1875,"end":1878},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":1887,"end":1897},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1962,"end":1967},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":2051,"end":2058},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":2059,"end":2071},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2093,"end":2098},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":2196,"end":2208},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2212,"end":2220},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2354,"end":2359},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T35"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T37"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T38"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T43"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T44"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T44"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T45"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T45"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T46"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T46"},{"id":"E18","type":"instanceOf","object":"T47"},{"id":"E19","type":"instanceOf","object":"T48"},{"id":"E20","type":"instanceOf","object":"T49"},{"id":"E21","type":"instanceOf","object":"T48"},{"id":"E22","type":"instanceOf","object":"T51"},{"id":"E23","type":"instanceOf","object":"T52"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T27","object":"T5"},{"id":"R3","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T6","object":"T5"},{"id":"R4","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T7","object":"T8"},{"id":"R5","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T12","object":"T11"},{"id":"R6","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T14","
