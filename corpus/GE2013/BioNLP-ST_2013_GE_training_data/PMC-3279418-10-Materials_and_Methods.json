The primer sequences were forward, 5'-CC ATG GCG ATG TCG CCG CCC GCC GGC GGT; reverse, 5'- AAG CTT CTA GGT GGA AGC TGC AGC AAG A. The Sharpin cDNA was cloned into expression vector pFLAG-CMV-2. Murine fibroblasts and macrophages were were used to express recombinant SHARPIN protein. Cells (2x104) were seeded in 96-well treated plates the day before transfection. After overnight incubation, 200 ng pFLAG-SHARPIN plasmids were transfected with 0.5 ul Lipofectamine 2000. 24 hours later, cells were incubated with fresh culture medium. After another 24 hours, cells were lysed to confirm the FLAG-SHARPIN expression by immunoblots with anti-FLAG. Cells with no transfection and transfected with empty vector pFLAG-CMV-2 were used as negative control in all transfection experiments.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":70,"end":77},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":270,"end":277},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":383,"end":390},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":403,"end":410},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":542,"end":549},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":733,"end":740},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":741,"end":751},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E2"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"}]}
