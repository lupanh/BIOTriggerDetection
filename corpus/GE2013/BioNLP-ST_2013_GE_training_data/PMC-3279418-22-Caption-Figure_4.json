At 0, 1 and 2 hours, total RNA was extracted and subject to qRT-PCR to measure the expression of Il12p40 (A,B), Il6 (C,D), Gmcsf (E,F), and Ifnb (G,H) mRNA. Bars represent mean +/- SD. Data are representative of two independent experiments.","catanns":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":305,"end":315},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":319,"end":326},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":334,"end":337},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":345,"end":350},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":362,"end":366},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E4"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M4","type":"Speculation","object":"E4"}]}
