Briefly, Jurkat T-cells were stimulated with PMA (162 nM) for 1 h, centrifuged (1000 x g, 8 min) and the supernatants were collected and stored at -80degreesC until use. Following centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 1 h aged media, where cells have been grown in, containing PMA. The same procedure was performed to collect media after 2 h and 6 h. The final collection of media was performed after 24 h.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":121,"end":125},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":127,"end":132},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":158,"end":162},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":190,"end":195},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":226,"end":229},"category":"Protein"}]}
