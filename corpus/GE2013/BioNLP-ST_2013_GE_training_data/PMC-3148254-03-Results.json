To begin evaluating potential contributions of HOIP to CD40 signaling, we assayed the upregulation of CD80 induced by engagement of CD40 on parental A20.2J, HOIP-deficient, and HOIP-reconstituted cells (Fig. 2). Compared to the parental cell line, the CD40-stimulated upregulation of CD80 was dramatically reduced in all HOIP-deficient cells tested. In contrast, upregulation of CD80 was restored in HOIP-reconstituted cells, confirming that the defect in CD80 upregulation in the HOIP-deficient cells was due to the disruption of Rnf31.\nCD40 signals in B cells can also contribute to the activation of DNA recombination in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus [11], [12]. This process, known as immunoglobulin class switching (or isotype switching), allows B cells, initially expressing IgM, to switch to IgA, IgG, or IgE depending on the class of antibody most appropriate for a particular immune response. Switching to IgE can be induced by the combination of IL-4 and CD40 signals. The gene rearrangement necessary for IgE production is preceded by the production of non-coding RNA transcripts from germline sequences in the IgE heavy chain locus [13]. To determine whether HOIP is required in the initiation of the class switching process, the relevant B cell lines were stimulated through CD40 in the presence of IL-4 and tested for production of germline epsilon (GLepsilon) transcripts (Fig. 3). Anti-CD40 antibody stimulation alone or together with IL-4 induced GLepsilon transcription in parental A20.2J cells as expected. In contrast, only low levels of GLepsilon expression were detected in HOIP-deficient cells stimulated with either anti-CD40 antibody alone or anti-CD40 and IL-4. Normal levels of GLepsilon expression were induced in HOIP-reconstituted cells stimulated with anti-CD40 antibody alone or together with IL-4. Collectively, these data demonstrate that HOIP has a critical role in cellular responses to CD40 signaling.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":8,"end":16},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":21,"end":25},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":26,"end":34},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":35,"end":39},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":40,"end":52},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":57,"end":67},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":71,"end":87},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":88,"end":101},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":102,"end":112},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":116,"end":120},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":132,"end":143},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":144,"end":154},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":158,"end":162},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":315,"end":319},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":323,"end":327},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":354,"end":366},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":370,"end":374},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":375,"end":382},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":386,"end":396},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":400,"end":404},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":425,"end":429},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":445,"end":449},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":450,"end":463},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":520,"end":524},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":525,"end":535},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":536,"end":548},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":552,"end":556},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":574,"end":581},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":589,"end":593},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":594,"end":603},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":631,"end":643},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":647,"end":651},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":668,"end":672},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":673,"end":686},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":714,"end":720},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":724,"end":728},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":729,"end":741},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":749,"end":753},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":754,"end":763},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":774,"end":777},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":785,"end":795},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":799,"end":804},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":806,"end":810},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1231,"end":1235},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1240,"end":1244},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1446,"end":1450},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1563,"end":1567},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1587,"end":1591},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":1607,"end":1617},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1621,"end":1637},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1639,"end":1648},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1726,"end":1730},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":1731,"end":1738},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1739,"end":1748},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":1749,"end":1762},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1833,"end":1842},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":1843,"end":1853},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1871,"end":1875},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":1876,"end":1885},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1957,"end":1961},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1980,"end":1989},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":1990,"end":2000},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":2006,"end":2013},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2017,"end":2021},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":2022,"end":2035},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2100,"end":2104},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2148,"end":2152},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2198,"end":2202},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},
