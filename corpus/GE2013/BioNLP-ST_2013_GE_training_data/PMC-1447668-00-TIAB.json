Herein we describe downstream signaling pathways targeted by Foxp3 that may negatively impact retroviral pathogenesis. Overexpression of Foxp3 in HEK 293T and purified CD4+ T cells resulted in a dose-dependent and time-dependent decrease in basal levels of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal forkhead (FKH) domain, critical for nuclear localization and DNA-binding activity, abrogated the ability of Foxp3 to suppress NF-kappaB activity in HEK 293T cells, but not in Jurkat or primary human CD4+ T cells. We further demonstrate that Foxp3 suppressed the transcription of two human retroviral promoters (HIV-1 and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I [HTLV-I]) utilizing NF-kappaB-dependent and NF-kappaB-independent mechanisms. Examination of the latter identified the cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) pathway as a target of Foxp3. Finally, comparison of the percent Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ T cells to the HTLV-I proviral load in HTLV-I-infected asymptomatic carriers and patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis suggested that high Foxp3 expression is associated with low proviral load and absence of disease. These results suggest an expanded role for Foxp3 in regulating NF-kappaB- and CREB-dependent cellular and viral gene expression.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":196,"end":201},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":334,"end":339},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":392,"end":406},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":410,"end":415},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":441,"end":444},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":576,"end":584},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":592,"end":631},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":633,"end":641},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":646,"end":653},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":654,"end":666},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":675,"end":682},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":718,"end":723},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":809,"end":812},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":851,"end":856},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1159,"end":1164},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1201,"end":1206},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1207,"end":1210},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1211,"end":1215},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1385,"end":1389},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1390,"end":1395},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1396,"end":1406},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1511,"end":1516},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"partOf","subject":"T17","object":"T6"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"causeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E3"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"causeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E5"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E4"},{"id":"R9","type":"locationOf","subject":"T19","object":"E4"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E6"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E8"}]}
