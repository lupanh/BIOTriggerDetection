Interestingly, adding M-CSF did not alter NF-kappaB DNA binding by EMSA. In contrast, after transiently transfecting human MDMs with pNF-kappaB-SEAP constructs containing four NF-kappaB consensus binding sequences, M-CSF treatment of the transfected cells resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in SEAP release in the culture media compared to PBS (vehicle)-treated transfected MDMs (Figure 1B). As a control, the pTAL-SEAP construct lacking NF-kappaB binding sites was used. Cells transfected with the pTAL-SEAP construct did not produce SEAP in the absence or presence of M-CSF (Figure 1B).\nWe next investigated whether M-CSF induced NF-kappaB activity in the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with either the NF-kappaB-SEAP reporter or control pTAL-SEAP construct. As shown in Figure 1C, M-CSF treatment of RAW 264.7 cells increased NF-kappaB reporter activity by 2.5-fold over that of non-treated cells. Together, our data demonstrate that M-CSF induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity in macrophages.","catanns":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1256,"end":1265},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1266,"end":1275},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1285,"end":1293},"category":"Positive_regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T2"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T3"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"}]}
