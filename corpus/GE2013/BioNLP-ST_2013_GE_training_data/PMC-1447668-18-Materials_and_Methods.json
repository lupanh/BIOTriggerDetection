Nuclear extracts were prepared from HEK 293T cells transfected with a control vector (EGFP) or Foxp3 expression vector (1,000 ng) in the presence or absence of forskolin (10 muM for 4 h) using the TransFactor Extraction Kit (BD Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined using a Biophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Nuclear extracts (20 mug) were incubated in preblocked wells containing plate-bound double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to an ATF/CREB consensus sequence (...TGACATCA...). Wells were washed, incubated with the appropriate primary antibody, washed, incubated with secondary antibody (HRP-labeled), washed again, and finally developed with TMB substrate. Colorimetric reactions were read using a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at an absorbance of 655 nm.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":54,"end":60},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":65,"end":70},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":75,"end":82},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":311,"end":316},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":317,"end":327},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T4"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T4"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"}]}
