For IL4 studies, splenocytes were cultured for 3 d in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml IL4. Cells were seeded on day 3 in triplicate in a 96-well plate at 2.5 x 106 cells/ml at 100 mul per well. MTS reagent was added for 4 h and absorbance was read at 540 nm; values plotted were subtracted from blanks. For neutralization assays, splenocytes were seeded at 5 x 106 cells/ml at 100 mul per well on day of harvest and IL4, rat IgG1 anti-mouse IL4, or rat IgG1 isotype control (R&D Systems) were added at the concentrations indicated in the figures. Cultures were pulsed for 4 h with MTS reagent 1 d post-seeding. For inhibitor studies, splenocytes were seeded at 1 x 107 cells/ml at 100 mul per well on day of harvest, and inhibitors were added at the concentrations indicated in the figures. The inhibitors BAY11-7085, rapamycin, triciribine, U0126, SB202190, and cucurbitacin I were purchased from EMD Biosciences. For non-malignant splenocyte cultures, B cell activation was induced with 10 mug/ml of goat F(ab') anti-mouse IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cultures were pulsed for 4 h with MTS reagent 1 d post-seeding.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":302,"end":305},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":389,"end":392},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":719,"end":722},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":744,"end":747},"category":"Protein"}]}
