After ICS FACS, data were collected on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star). For ELISA, cells were similarly restimulated for 48 hr and supernatant was collected and analyzed for IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-gamma as described before (Shoemaker et al., 2006).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":97,"end":100},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":121,"end":125},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":463,"end":467},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":469,"end":474},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":480,"end":489},"category":"Protein"}]}
