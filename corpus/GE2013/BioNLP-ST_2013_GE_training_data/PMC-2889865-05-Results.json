Bcl10 is a signalling protein that acts upstream of NF-kappaB in concert with CARMA1 and MALT1 and has been suggested to directly regulate NF-kappaB activity in T-cells [27]. Therefore, Bcl10 activation was evaluated in both control and PMA stimulated cells after 10 min, 1 h, 6 h, and 24 h using western blot analysis. The Bcl10 levels decreased following treatment with PMA, while in control cells, Bcl10 returned to higher levels by 24 h (figure 7c). This suggests that Bcl10 is involved in the PMA dependent inhibition of NF-kappaB activation.","catanns":[{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":32,"end":41},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":42,"end":47},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":48,"end":59},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":211,"end":222},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":239,"end":249},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":263,"end":268},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":341,"end":347},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":352,"end":357},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":449,"end":454},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":455,"end":465},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":587,"end":592},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":600,"end":609},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":664,"end":669},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":670,"end":688},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":736,"end":741},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E6"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E4"}]}
