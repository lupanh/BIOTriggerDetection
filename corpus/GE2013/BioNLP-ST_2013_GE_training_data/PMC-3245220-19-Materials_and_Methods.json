Briefly, human monocytes (5x106) were incubated with inhibitors for 30 minutes in X-vivo medium and restimulated with 100 ng/ml M-CSF overnight. The cells were removed from the culture dish using Accutase (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD PharMingen). Annexin V-FITC and PI double negative cells were considered non-apoptotic cells for statistical analysis.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":9},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":103,"end":112},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":425,"end":434},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":508,"end":517},"category":"Protein"}]}
