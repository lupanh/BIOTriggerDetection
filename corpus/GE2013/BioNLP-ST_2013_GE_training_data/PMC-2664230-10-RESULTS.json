Cytoplasmic I-kappaBalpha phosphorylation was markedly increased following LPS stimulation when compared to control (100 +/- 0 vs. 20 +/- 18; P < 0.05). The addition of PTX significantly downregulated LPS-induced I-kappaBalpha phosphorylation (P = 0.02; Figure 2)\nIn a similar fashion, nuclear NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation was increased following LPS stimulation (100 +/- 0 vs. 38 +/- 20; P < 0.01). PTX similarly decreased LPS-induced NF-kappaB p65 nuclear phosphorylation, a marker of NF-kappaB activation and nuclear translocation (100 +/- 0 vs. 40 +/- 6; P =0.03; Figure 3A).\nEMSAs were then performed to verify the PTX-induced alterations in nuclear phosphorylation resulted in similar effects on the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB. The addition of PTX to LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells resulted in comparable downregulation of DNA binding activity, similar to the observed downregulation of NF-kappaB phosphorylation (Figure 3B).","catanns":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":69,"end":74},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":97,"end":108},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":112,"end":125},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":199,"end":206},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":217,"end":230},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":244,"end":257},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":258,"end":273},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":287,"end":296},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":297,"end":306},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":419,"end":432},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":437,"end":444},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":445,"end":458},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":459,"end":474},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":536,"end":539},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":540,"end":555},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":560,"end":569},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":570,"end":579},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":647,"end":656},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":661,"end":668},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":679,"end":682},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":691,"end":706},"category":"Phosphorylation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E9"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E10"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E10","object":"E11"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"E11","object":"E12"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"E14","object":"E13"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"E15","object":"E14"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E15"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"}]}
