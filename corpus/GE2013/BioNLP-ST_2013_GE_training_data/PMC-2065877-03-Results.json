Similar numbers of naive (IgM+IgD+IgG-) splenic B cells with a strong bias towards kappa light chain were detected from wild-type or LMP1 transgenic mice, indicating that LMP1 signaling does not affect B cell maturation (unpublished data). Flow cytometry analysis of the SCID-passaged wild-type and LMP1 transgenic lymphomas revealed an IgMhighIgDlow phenotype (Figure 2A), indicative of marginal zone, B-1, or memory B cells. B-1 cells are further separated into CD5+ (B-1a) and CD5- (B-1b) subsets. To differentiate between these cell types, lymphoma cells were further analyzed for the B-1a marker CD5. All (5/5) of the tested LMP1 transgenic lymphomas displayed an IgMhighIgDlowCD5+ phenotype (Figure 2A), an expression pattern that distinguishes B-1a cells. Interestingly, a spontaneous wild-type lymphoma also developed in B-1a cells (Figure 2A). These cells are an interesting population that is self replenishing with an increased likelihood to become malignant in aged mice [30]. Analysis of LMP1 transgenic mice before the development of lymphoma showed similar numbers of splenic B-1a (CD19+CD5+) and B-1b or B-2 populations (CD19+CD5-), indicating that LMP1 does not affect B cell differentiation (Figure 2B).\nDue to allelic exclusion, mature B cells that have been exposed to antigen will typically express only one heavy chain isotype (IgG, IgE, or IgA) and either a kappa or lambda light chain. Interestingly, 2/5 LMP1 transgenic lymphomas analyzed (lymphomas 2 and 4) were doubly positive for low levels of both kappa and lambda light chains (Figure 2A). Previous characterization of the LMP1 lymphomas had revealed that the lymphomas were clonal as determined by Ig heavy chain rearrangement [26], and analysis of kappa chain rearrangement (Figure S1) of the samples analyzed in this study confirmed clonality. To further assess light chain expression, the passaged samples were tested by immunoblotting for kappa and lambda light chains (Figure 2C). Interestingly, very low levels of expression of both light chains were detected by flow cytometry. The low levels of expression may reflect a limitation of the total number of light chains that can be expressed on the surface of a B cell. In agreement with the flow cytometry analysis, LMP1 transgenic lymphomas 2 and 4 were also positive for kappa and lambda light chains by immunoblot analysis (Figure 2C), confirming that these lymphomas express both light chains. A previous study of mice that developed leukemia due to an expansion of self-reactive B-1a cells determined that the B-1a leukemias were also doubly positive for kappa and lambda light chains [31]. These findings indicate that expression of LMP1 in B-1a cells promotes the development of malignancy and can result in the aberrant escape from allelic exclusion.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":79,"end":83},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":178,"end":182},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":183,"end":193},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":448,"end":452},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":486,"end":490},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":614,"end":618},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":779,"end":782},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":795,"end":798},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":916,"end":919},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":945,"end":949},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":997,"end":1000},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1320},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1412,"end":1416},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1417,"end":1420},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1452,"end":1456},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1457,"end":1460},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1480,"end":1484},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1744,"end":1748},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1919,"end":1923},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":2569,"end":2573},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2978,"end":2988},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":2992,"end":2996},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T21","object":"E2"}]}
