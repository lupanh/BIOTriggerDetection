Splenocytes were cultured in the presence (grey bars) or absence (black bars) of IL4 for 3 d. The results are the mean +/- SEM of triplicate samples averaged from multiple mice where \"n\" the number of mice analyzed is as follows: n = 2 for WT lymphocytes and WT lymphomas, n = 11 for LMP1 transgenic lymphocytes, and n = 13 for LMP1 transgenic lymphomas.\n(B) EMA exclusion of CD19+ gated splenocytes from WT and LMP1 transgenic mice showing percentage of viable B cells cultured with (white bars) or without (black bars) IL4 for 2 d.\n(C) Flow cytometry analysis for incorporated BrdU in WT and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma cells cultured with or without IL4 for 2 d. Shown are the results from WT lymphoma 1 and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma 2. Percentages of cells in each quadrant are shown.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":98,"end":102},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":201,"end":204},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":404,"end":408},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":448,"end":452},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":496,"end":500},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":532,"end":536},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":641,"end":644},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":714,"end":718},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":770,"end":773},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":828,"end":832},"category":"Protein"}]}
