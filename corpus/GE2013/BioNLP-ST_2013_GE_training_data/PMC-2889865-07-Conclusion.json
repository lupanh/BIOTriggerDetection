{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"2889865","division_id":7,"section":"Conclusion","text":"In the present study, IL-6 release was found to be associated with NF-kappaB activity while CXCL8 release more closely correlated with AP-1 activity. Treatment of Jurkat T-cells with PMA was more potent than HK E. coli at elevating the CXCL8 levels. PMA induced AP-1 activation and down-regulated NF-kappaB while HK E. coli up-regulated NF-kappaB without affecting AP-1 activity. In addition, the temporal induction pattern of AP-1 correlated to the release of CXCL8 while IL-6 followed the NF-kappaB activity. Likewise, blocking NF-kappaB activation resulted in a complete inhibition of IL-6 while the CXCL8 levels remained elevated as shown both at the protein and mRNA level. Furthermore, the CXCL8 release was down-regulated by inhibition of JNK activity. The present study indicates that in Jurkat T-cells, IL-6 is regulated through NF-kappaB while CXCL8 regulation is independent of NF-kappaB and closely associated with AP-1 activation.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":26},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":27,"end":34},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":92,"end":97},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":98,"end":105},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":222,"end":231},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":236,"end":241},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":450,"end":457},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":461,"end":466},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":473,"end":477},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":551,"end":559},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":574,"end":584},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":588,"end":592},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":603,"end":608},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":616,"end":624},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":625,"end":633},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":696,"end":701},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":702,"end":709},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":714,"end":728},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":812,"end":816},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":820,"end":829},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":854,"end":859},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":860,"end":870},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":874,"end":885},"category":"Regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E9"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E10"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E11"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E12"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E13"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E7"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E13"}]}
