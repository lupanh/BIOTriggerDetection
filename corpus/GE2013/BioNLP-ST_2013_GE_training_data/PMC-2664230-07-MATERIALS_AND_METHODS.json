Isolated mononuclear cells were incubated according to the treatment groups described above in the presence and absence of pretreatment with H89 (10 muM) for 1 hour at 37degreesC. The dose of H89 was chosen based on previous work which demonstrated specific and complete inhibition of PKA at this concentration.10 Since the activity of this inhibitor is both specific and consistent at this specified dose, we did not include experiments with additional PKA inhibitors with this set of experiments. The TNF-alpha concentration in the supernatant was measured quantitatively by ELISA. The results are expressed in pg/mL.","catanns":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":19,"end":26},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":44,"end":53},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":54,"end":64},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":81,"end":85},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":96,"end":105},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":106,"end":116},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":146,"end":157},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":165,"end":176},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":184,"end":191},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":192,"end":201},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":202,"end":212},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":795,"end":804},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E9"}]}
