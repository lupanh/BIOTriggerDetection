In MDMs pretreated with PKC inhibitors (Ro-31-8220, Go-6976, or BAPTA/AM) and stimulated with M-CSF, cleaved caspase-3 was elevated to levels of cells treated with vehicle alone (Figure 3A). In contrast, cells incubated with M-CSF and vehicle had less cleaved caspase-3 than cells incubated with vehicle alone or M-CSF with PKC inhibitors. These data supported the hypothesis that M-CSF-induced NF-kappaB activity was regulated by conventional PKCs, not novel PKCs.\nTo confirm that PKC inhibition decreased cell survival, cells were treated with M-CSF in the absence or presence of PKC inhibitors and then also examined for apoptosis by Annexin V/PI staining. PKC inhibitors in the presence of M-CSF reduced the number of Annexin V/PI negative MDMs compared to cells treated with M-CSF alone (Figure 3B). These observations further suggested that MDM survival is promoted by M-CSF and critically involves conventional PKCs and NF-kappaB activity.","catanns":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":249,"end":259},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":263,"end":270},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":271,"end":280},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":475,"end":482},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":483,"end":492},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":497,"end":505},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":621,"end":625},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":626,"end":633},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":634,"end":643},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1011,"end":1020},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1096,"end":1105},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1109,"end":1117},"category":"Negative_regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E7"}]}
