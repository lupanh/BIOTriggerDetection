LMP1 mice were genotyped by Southern blot and PCR analysis of tail DNA as described previously [26]. Spleen and liver sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin, and 5-mum sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological analysis. Lymphomas were passaged by intraperitoneal injection of 1 x 108 splenocytes into SCID mice and sacrificed upon development of an extended abdomen. Animals were housed in the Association for Assessment and Accreditation for Animal Care-approved animal facility at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":31,"end":35},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":184,"end":188},"category":"Protein"}]}
