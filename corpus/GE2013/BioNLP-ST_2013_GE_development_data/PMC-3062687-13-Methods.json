Wu (NCI, Bethesda) and U. Siebenlist (NIAID, Bethesda), respectively. The HA-IkappaBalpha and IKKbeta (K44A)-Flag plasmids were purchased from Addgene44, 45. The Flag-RPS3, GST-RPS3, HA-RPS3, VN-HA, NleH1-HA plasmids were described previously6, 9. The point mutants of RPS3 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change Kit (Stratagene) with primers forward 5'-CTGCCTGACCACGTGGCCATTGTGGAACCCAAA-3' and reverse 5'-TTTGGGTTCCACAATGGCCACGTGGTCAGGCAG-3' for S209A. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":23,"end":42},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":44,"end":63},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":69,"end":91},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":197,"end":212},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":217,"end":236},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":285,"end":294},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":296,"end":304},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":306,"end":313},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":315,"end":320},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":322,"end":330},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":392,"end":396},"category":"Protein"}]}
