Cells were then treated with various concentrations of 10 kDa (triangles), or 40 kDa dCGN (squares). B: THP-1 cells treated with 1 mg/ml of 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or with 1 mg/ml of 40 kDa dCGN (C40) were lysed after various periods of time. Proteins in cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then Western blotted for IkappaBalpha or alpha-tubulin as loading control. C: Degraded carrageenans (dCGN) induced activation of NF-kappaB. THP-1 cells were treated with nothing (control), or with 1 mg/ml of 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or with 1 mg/ml of 40 kDa dCGN (C40) for 30 minutes at 37degreesC. Nuclei were isolated and lysed. Proteins in nuclear extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then Western blotted for NF-kappaB p50 subunit (p50) or NF-kappaB p65 subunit (p65). Lower panels show Western blots of nuclear ERK revealing equivalent amount of protein in each sample. Data are representative of three separate experiments. D: Degraded carrageenan (dCGN) induced activation of NF-kappaB. Nuclei isolated from THP-1 cells were fluorescence-stained for NF-kappaB p50 subunit or NF-kappaB p65 subunit before (filled area) or after cells were treated with 1 mg/ml of 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or with 1 mg/ml of 40 kDa dCGN (C40) for 30 minutes at 37degreesC. Dashed line corresponds to nuclei stained only with secondary fluorescence antibody. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed by flow cytometry as described.","catanns":[{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":121,"end":128},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":129,"end":139},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":143,"end":153},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":474,"end":486},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":869,"end":872},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":882,"end":885},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":900,"end":903},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":913,"end":916},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1213,"end":1216},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1238,"end":1241},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T4","object":"T3"},{"id":"R2","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T6","object":"T5"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"}]}
