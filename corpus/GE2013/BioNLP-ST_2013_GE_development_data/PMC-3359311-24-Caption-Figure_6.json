Cell culture supernatants were assayed for (A) NF-kappaB/AP-1 activity, (B) IL-8, and (C) IL-1beta secretion (n = 3-6 experiments). Using the same stimulation method, THP-1 reporter cells were treated with Bay11-7082 (20 microM) for 1 hour prior to priming with heat-killed PAO1 or live PAO1. Supernatants were assayed at 24 hours for (D) NF-kappaB/AP-1 activity, (E) IL-8, and (F) IL-1beta secretion (n = 3-5). PBMCs from CF patients (n = 11-15) and controls (n = 10-13) were treated with z-YVAD-fmk (20 microM) or Bay11-7082 (10 microM) and stimulated with live PAO1 (MOI = 1), ATP (5 mM), or Poly(dA:dT) (1 microg/ml) according to the schedule in Figure 1. (G) IL-1beta and (H) IL-8 levels were measured at 24 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using two way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. *, **, and *** signify P<0.05, 0.01, and 0.001.","catanns":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":21,"end":32},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":47,"end":55},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":56,"end":66},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":71,"end":80},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":81,"end":85},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":392,"end":400},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":401,"end":410},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":684,"end":692},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":693,"end":702},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":966,"end":974},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E1","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E8"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E8"}]}
