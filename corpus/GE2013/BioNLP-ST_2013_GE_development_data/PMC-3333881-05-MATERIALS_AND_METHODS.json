Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using anti-p24 antibody measured virion concentration. PBMCs, Jurkat or U937 cells (5 x 107) were infected with HXB2 Env-pseudotyped virions (500 ng of p24) by spinoculation, as previously described (50).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":121,"end":124},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":162,"end":165},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":397,"end":400},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":432,"end":435},"category":"Protein"}]}
