(B) Nuclear GATA-3 immunoreactivity in PBMCs from seven steroid-naive asthma patients 2 h following inhaled FP treatment (100 or 500 microg via spacer). The median and interquartile ranges for each treatment are presented as a box-and-whiskers plot (n = 7); * p<0.05 Wilcoxon's rank test compared with placebo. (C) Immunoblotting analyses of PBMCs demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in nuclear expression of GATA-3, and increased cytoplasmic GATA-3 expression after inhalation of FP. (D) Immunoblotting analyses of PBMCs demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in nuclear expression of GATA-3, and increased cytoplasmic GATA-3 expression 2 h after inhalation of FP. Histone H1 and MEK-1 immunoblotting confirmed equivalent total protein loading for the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions respectively. Quantification of the densitometry data in (C) and (D) is shown as a box-and-whiskers plot of results from n = 6 participants for which data were available. *p<0.05 compared to control. (E) Western blot analyses of PBMCs demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in dual phosphorylation (threonine-180 and tyrosine-182) of p38 MAPK after inhalation of FP (500 microg). The results shown in (E) are representative of samples from two participants.","catanns":[{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":31,"end":38},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":39,"end":45},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":46,"end":53},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":54,"end":66},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":168,"end":170},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":175,"end":181},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":182,"end":189},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":190,"end":202},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":216,"end":222},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":572,"end":581},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":582,"end":590},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":594,"end":601},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":602,"end":612},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":616,"end":622},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":628,"end":637},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":638,"end":649},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":650,"end":656},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":657,"end":667},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":759,"end":767},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":771,"end":778},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":779,"end":789},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":793,"end":799},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":815,"end":826},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":827,"end":833},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":834,"end":844},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":888,"end":893},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"locationOf","subject":"T11","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"locationOf","subject":"T13","object":"E3"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E4"},{"id":"R7","type":"locationOf","subject":"T13","object":"E4"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E6"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E9"},{"id":"R12","type":"locationOf","subject":"T17","object":"E9"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"E10","object":"E8"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E10"},{"id":"R15","type":"locationOf","subject":"T20","object":"E10"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E11"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E12"},{"id":"R18","type":"locationOf","subject":"T23","object":"E12"},{"id":"R19","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E13"},{"id":"R20","type":"locationOf","subject":"T25","object":"E13"}]}
