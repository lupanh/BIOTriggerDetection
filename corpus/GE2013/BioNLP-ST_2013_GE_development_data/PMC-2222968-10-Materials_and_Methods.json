The purity of CD4+ T cells was initially tested by FACS and was >= 95%. Monoclonality of T cell clones was confirmed by TCR-chain mapping and was identified to be Vbeta8 positive. The clones were characterized by high IL-4 secretion.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":16},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":27,"end":30},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":108,"end":111},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":197,"end":200},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":396,"end":400},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":401,"end":405},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":406,"end":415},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E2"}]}
