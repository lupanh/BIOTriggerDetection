Briefly, aliquots (5 x 106 cells) were suspended in 0.3 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and subjected to a double electrical pulse (0.22 V, 960 microF) in the presence of annealed siRNA (200 pmol); electroporated cells were washed and cultured in complete medium. RNA interference was performed with: siRNA Tat sense, CUGCUUGUACCAAUUGCUAUU and siRNA Tat antisense, UAGCAAUUGGUACAAGCAGUU; siRNA control sense, CUGCUUGUCACA AUUGCUAUU and siRNA control antisense, UAGCAAUUGUGACAAGCAGUU. RNA interference of p65 and IkappaB-alpha was performed with SMART pool siRNA p65 and IkappaB-alpha (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL, USA).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":467,"end":482},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":510,"end":529},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":654,"end":666},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":670,"end":673},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":678,"end":691},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":722,"end":731},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":736,"end":749},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E2"}]}
