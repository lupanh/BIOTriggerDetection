The expression of various cell surface molecules was analyzed by flow cytometry as described in materials and methods. Both forms of dCGN clearly stimulated expression of ICAM-1 (CD54) on PBM and THP-1 cells (Fig. 4A). The increase in ICAM-1 expression was higher on THP-1 cells treated with 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 4B). Another surface antigen, the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (CD58) was slightly reduced on PBM after treatment with 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules of class I (HLA-ABC) and of class II (HLA-DR), as well as the monocyte marker CD14, seemed to be reduced by treatment with dCGN (Fig. 4B). However, these differences were not statistically significant.\nTreatment with dCGN also induced a strong aggregation of monocytes, detected by phase contrast inverse microscopy (Fig. 5). Although this effect was easily observed in monocytes incubated with the 10 kDa dCGN (Fig. 5B), a more robust cell aggregation was observed in monocytes incubated with the 40 kDa dCGN (Fig. 5C). ICAM-1 has been proposed to be the main adhesion molecule responsible for monocyte aggregation. To confirm this, monocytes were incubated with both types of dCGN in the presence of an anti-ICAM-1 antibody, an anti-CD58 antibody and an isotype control IgG1 antibody. The anti-ICAM-1 antibody effectively blocked the cell aggregates induced by dCGN (Fig. 5D, 5E), strongly suggesting that indeed ICAM-1 is responsible for monocyte aggregation. Both the control IgG1 and the anti-CD58 antibody did not modify monocyte aggregation (data not shown).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":7,"end":17},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":21,"end":28},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":407,"end":417},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":418,"end":428},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":432,"end":438},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":440,"end":444},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":484,"end":492},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":496,"end":502},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":503,"end":513},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":605,"end":645},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":647,"end":651},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":666,"end":673},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":740,"end":750},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":859,"end":874},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":875,"end":879},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":894,"end":901},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1318,"end":1324},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1712,"end":1718},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T3","object":"T2"},{"id":"R2","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T6","object":"T5"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E4"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E6"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E7"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E8"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E9"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E9"}]}
