Cd45.1 and Rag2-/- mice were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and Taconic, respectively. For the in vivo Foxp3 conversion assay, naive CD4+ T cells from Cbfb CD4-cre or control mice (harboring a Foxp3-IRES-GFP allele) were adoptively transferred into Rag-deficient mice. 5 x 106 cells were used per transfer. 6 wk later, TCRbeta+CD4+ gated cells from the spleen, mesenteric lymph node (MLN), and lamina propria of the small intestine were analyzed for Foxp3-GFP expression. All analyses and experiments were performed on animals at 6-8 wk of age. Animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the animal facility of the Skirball Institute, and experiments were performed in accordance with approved protocols for the New York University Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":6,"end":10},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":17},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":18,"end":21},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":26,"end":31},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":31,"end":34},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":115,"end":121},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":126,"end":130},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":238,"end":243},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":268,"end":271},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":286,"end":290},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":291,"end":294},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":295,"end":298},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":328,"end":333},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":339,"end":342},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":384,"end":387},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":388,"end":397},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":454,"end":461},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":462,"end":465},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":585,"end":594},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":595,"end":605},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T18","object":"E2"}]}
