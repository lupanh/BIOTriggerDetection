Ramos cells, which have been described to express BMP-6 mRNA endogenously [20], and the T cell line Jurkat, served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Endogenous BMP-6 mRNA levels in normal B cells were quantified by real-time RT-PCR after stimulation with anti-IgM for different time points. Interestingly, the up-regulation of BMP-6 mRNA was characteristic of an early-to intermediate inducible gene with maximal upregulation four hours after the addition of anti-IgM. The level of BMP-6 mRNA was back to baseline after 24 hours upon stimulation (Figure 10). Furthermore, both FCS and human AB-serum induced significant upregulation of BMP-6 mRNA (Figure 11). Interestingly, in a separate study we have found that normal human T cells do not express BMP-6 mRNA after activation (Sivertsen et al, manuscript in preparation). Next, we wanted to detect BMP-6 protein in normal B-cells and tested various commercially available antibodies. However, in our hands these anti-BMP-6 antibodies did only recognize the recombinant BMP-6 protein and not the native protein.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":6,"end":16},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":42,"end":47},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":201,"end":208},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":209,"end":214},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":275,"end":282},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":283,"end":288},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":408,"end":413},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":558,"end":571},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":575,"end":580},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":661,"end":673},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":730,"end":735},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":745,"end":761},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":848,"end":855},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":868,"end":880},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":884,"end":889},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":990,"end":997},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":998,"end":1003},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1103},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1222},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1243,"end":1252},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1269,"end":1274},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1291,"end":1309},"category":"Anaphora"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T13","object":"T12"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E4"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E6"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E8"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E9"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E10"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E11"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E9"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E10"},{"id":"M4","type":"Negation","object":"E11"}]}
