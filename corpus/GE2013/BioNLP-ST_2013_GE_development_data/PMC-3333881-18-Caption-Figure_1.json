Jurkat cells (5 x 107) were transfected with siRNA Tat or siRNA control (2 nmol), or left untransfected; 24 h later, cells were infected with HXB2-pseudotyped NL4-3.Luc.R-E- virions (500 ng of p24) and harvested at the indicated time. (A) Tat expression was measured in total RNA by real-time PCR, while the luciferase activity was measured in whole cell extracts. (B) Nuclear extracts (10 microg) were analysed for the p65 and p50 binding to the NF-kappaB double-stranded oligonucleotide using the NF-kappaB Transcription Factor ELISA Assay kit (Cayman). (C) The expression of p65 and IkappaB-alpha was analysed by 12% SDS-PAGE and western blotting of nuclear or cytosolic extracts (20 microg) using anti-p65 and anti-IkappaB-alpha antibodies. Histone H1 and Hexokinase II were detected with specific antibodies as markers of nuclear and cytosolic extracts, respectively. Densitometry values (D) of the bands were expressed as fold increase above the control (mock). (D) IKK activity was measured in cytosolic extracts (100 microg) by using HTScan IKK Kinase Assay (Cell Signaling Technology). Values (mean +/- SE, n = 3) are shown.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":136,"end":145},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":284,"end":287},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":330,"end":333},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":334,"end":344},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":399,"end":409},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":511,"end":514},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":519,"end":522},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":523,"end":530},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":655,"end":665},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":669,"end":672},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":677,"end":690},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":851,"end":864},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E5"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M4","type":"Speculation","object":"E4"},{"id":"M5","type":"Speculation","object":"E5"}]}
