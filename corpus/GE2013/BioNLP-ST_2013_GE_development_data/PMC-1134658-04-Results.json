To further elucidate the role of BMPs in human B cells, we performed western blot analysis for type I and type II BMP receptors. This analysis revealed that the type I receptors Act-RIA, BMP-RIB and the type II receptors BMP-RII and Act-RIIb are expressed on resting human B-cells (Figure 4). Ramos cells expressed the type I receptors Act-RIA, weakly BMP-RIB and the type II receptor BMP-RII, but more weakly than normal B cells (Figure 4). HL60 cells were used for comparison and weakly expressed Act-RIA and BMP-RII.\nTaken together, these data show that normal human B cells and Ramos cells express a set of BMP receptors, previously shown to bind BMP-6 [16].","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":27},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":322,"end":329},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":331,"end":338},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":365,"end":372},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":377,"end":385},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":390,"end":399},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":449,"end":458},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":480,"end":487},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":496,"end":503},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":529,"end":536},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":633,"end":642},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":643,"end":650},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":655,"end":662},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":790,"end":794},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":795,"end":800},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E9"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E10"}]}
