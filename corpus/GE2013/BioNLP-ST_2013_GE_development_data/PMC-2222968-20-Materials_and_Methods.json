For cell surface marker staining, cells were incubated for 20 min at 4degreesC in staining buffer with the following antibodies: anti-CD152-PE (CTLA-4; BD), anti-PD-1 (eBiosciences), anti-GITR (R & D Systems), anti-CD69 (Beckman Coulter), anti-CD103 (DakoCytomation), anti-CD62L (Beckman Coulter), or anti-HLA-DR (Beckman Coulter). The controls were FITC, PE, or ECD-conjugated mouse IgG1 or rat IgG2a. For staining of mouse cells, the following mAbs from BD Biosciences were used following standard techniques as described above: anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD25. Anti-FcgammaRII/III antibody (2.4G2, ATCC) was included in all stainings to reduce nonspecific antibody binding. To isolate naive murine CD4 T cells from murine DO11.10 or DO11.10xCD2-GATA3 T cells, cells were stained with anti-CD25-FITC, anti-CD62L-PE, and anti-CD4-APC prior to sorting. Dead cells were excluded with 4'',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). To analyze murine Foxp3 expression in inducible Treg cultures, cells were stained intracellularly with anti-Foxp3-PE according to manufacturer's instruction, in conjunction with anti-CD4-APC and LIVE/DEAD fixable dead cell stain kit (Invitrogen) to discriminate live cells. All monoclonal antibodies for murine cell stainings were purchased from eBioscience or BD Biosciences.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":32,"end":37},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":38,"end":48},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":129,"end":133},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":273,"end":278},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":509,"end":514},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":537,"end":541},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":563,"end":567},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":590,"end":594},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":619,"end":624},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":648,"end":653},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":911,"end":914},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":921,"end":924},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":935,"end":939},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1078,"end":1081},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1121,"end":1124},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1125,"end":1130},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1169,"end":1173},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1185,"end":1190},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1204,"end":1207},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1317,"end":1322},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1323,"end":1333},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1407,"end":1412},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1482,"end":1485},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T19","object":"E2"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"}]}
