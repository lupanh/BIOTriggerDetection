To validate its use in this study as an NF-kappaB inhibitor, western blots for pro-IL-1beta were performed alongside inhibition of CFTR activity by CFTRinh172 in response to PAO1 at 4 hours after stimulation (Fig. 7a). Our results indicate that Bay11-7082 prevents production of pro-IL-1beta whereas CFTRinh172 does not seem to affect it. This was further corroborated by the ability Bay11-7082 to inhibit IkappaBalpha degradation at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 hours post PAO1 stimulation (Fig. 7b).","catanns":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":586,"end":593},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":594,"end":606},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":607,"end":618},"category":"Protein_catabolism"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T2"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T3"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"}]}
