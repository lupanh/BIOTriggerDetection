The purity of CD4+ T cells was initially tested by flow cytometry and was >=95%. Cells were stimulated with the following combination of mAbs to T cell surface molecules (Meiler et al., 2008): anti-CD2 (clone 4B2 and 6G4; 0.5 microg/ml), anti-CD3 (clone OKT3; 0.5 microg/ml), and anti-CD28 mAb (clone B7G5; 0.5 microg/ml; all from Sanquin) and cultured in serum-free AIM-V medium (Life Technologies) with the addition of 1 nmol/liter IL-2 (Roche). TGF-beta (R&D Systems) was used at 5 ng/ml, if not stated otherwise. A combination of PMA (25 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was used.\nHuman CD4+ CD127- CD25high and CD4+ CD127+ CD25neg cells were purified by flow cytometry using anti-CD127, anti-CD25-PC5 (Beckman Coulter), and anti-CD4-FITC antibodies (Dako).\nMouse naive (CD62Lhi44lo25-) CD4+ T cells were purified by flow cytometry and activated in vitro with 5 microg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 and 1 microg/ml soluble anti-CD28 antibodies (eBioscience) in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. Neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma and anti-IL-4 mAbs (BD) were used at 1 microg/ml concentrations when indicated.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":20,"end":23},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":141,"end":144},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":189,"end":192},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":204,"end":207},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":281,"end":284},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":465,"end":468},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":510,"end":513},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":552,"end":556},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":701,"end":705},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":715,"end":723},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":871,"end":874},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":876,"end":881},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":883,"end":887},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":896,"end":899},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":901,"end":906},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":908,"end":912},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":965,"end":970},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":977,"end":981},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1014,"end":1017},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1055,"end":1060},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1062,"end":1064},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1068},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1071,"end":1074},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1173,"end":1176},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1206,"end":1210},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1333,"end":1342},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1352,"end":1356},"category":"Protein"}]}
