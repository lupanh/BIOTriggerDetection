(A) HeLa cells were transfected with pRc/CMV-3xHA-p65 (5 microg) in presence or absence of p3xFLAG-Tat, p3xFLAG-Tat T,N(23,24)A, p3xFLAG-Tat K(50,51)A, p3xFLAG-Tat R(49-57)A, or p3xFLAG-Tat C(22,25,27)A (5 microg). FLAG-Tat proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody; immunocomplexes were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analysed by western blotting with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies. (B) In vitro translated p65 (5 microl) was incubated with GST-Tat, GST-Tat T,N(23,24)A, GST-Tat K(50,51)A, GST-Tat R(49-57)A, GST-Tat C(22,25,27)A, or GST (5 microg) conjugated with Glutathione-Sepharose. Protein complexes were recovered by GST-pull down, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and analysed by western blotting with anti-p65 or anti-GST antibodies. (C) Schematic representation of wild-type and mutant p65 proteins. (D) HeLa cells were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat (5 microg) in the presence or absence of pRc/CMV-3xHA-p65, pRc/CMV-3xHA-p65deltaC (1-318), or pRc/CMV-3xHA-p65deltaN (122-551) (5 microg). Wild-type and mutant HA-p65 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody; immunocomplexes were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analysed by western blotting with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies. (E) Recombinant p65 protein (100 ng; Active Motif Carlsbad, CA, USA) was 20 min incubated with 32P-labeled NF-kappaB double-stranded oligonucleotide in presence or absence of in vitro translated FLAG-Tat or FLAG-Tat C(22,25,27)A (5 microl); competitions were performed with 1.25- up to 40-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. DNA/protein complexes were separated by 6% PAGE in 0.5 x TBE buffer and analysed by autoradiography.
