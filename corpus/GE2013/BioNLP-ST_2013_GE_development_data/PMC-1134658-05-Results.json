Type I receptors can signal via several pathways. We examined the effect of BMP-6 on Smad phosphorylation, as the activation of Smad is considered to be a major signalling pathway for BMPs [17]. B cells were cultured in serum-free media over night and then treated with BMP-6 for various time points. Total protein lysates were prepared, and the amounts of the phosphorylated forms of Smad1/5/8 were determined by western blot analysis. Interestingly, treatment with 500 ng/ml BMP-6 induced phosphorylation of Smad. The BMP-6 induced phosphorylation was high at the earliest time point tested (15 minutes), and remained high for at least 48 hours (Figure 5). A similar phosphorylation was observed in Ramos cells, but not in HL60 cells (Figure 6). Furthermore, we also tested whether other known downstream signalling pathways of BMP-6 could be triggered by BMP-6 in human B cells. However, we did not observe any significant changes in the level of phospho-STAT3 or phospho-p38 upon BMP-6 treatment of B cells (data not shown).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":6,"end":13},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":14,"end":29},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":33,"end":38},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":39,"end":40},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":41,"end":42},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":216,"end":221},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":410,"end":415},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":501,"end":515},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":525,"end":530},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":531,"end":532},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":533,"end":534},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":617,"end":622},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":623,"end":630},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":631,"end":646},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":650,"end":654},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":660,"end":665},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":666,"end":673},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":674,"end":689},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":970,"end":975},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":998,"end":1003},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1073},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1090,"end":1097},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1098,"end":1103},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1107,"end":1114},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1115,"end":1118},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1129},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E18","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E19","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E20","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E21","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E22","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E23","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E24","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E25","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T17","object":"T7"},{"id":"R2","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T17","object":"T8"},{"id":"R3","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T17","object":"T9"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R6","type":"causeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R8","type":"causeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E3"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R10","type":"causeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E5"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E4"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E6"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E7"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E8"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E9"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"E11","object":"E10"},{"id":"R18","type":"causeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E10"},{"id":"R19","type":"themeOf","subject":"E13","object":"E12"},{"id":"R20","type":"causeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E12"},{"id":"R21","type":"themeOf","subject":"E15","object":"E14"},{"id":"R22","type":"causeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E14"},{"id":"R23","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E11"},{"id":"R24","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E13"},{"id":"R25","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E15"},{"id":"R26","type":"themeOf","subject":"E17","object":"E16"},{"id":"R27","type":"causeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E16"},{"id":"R28","type":"themeOf","subject":"E19","object":"E18"},{"id":"R29","type":"causeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E18"},{"id":"R30","type":"themeOf","subject":"E21","object":"E20"},{"id":"R31","type":"causeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E20"},{"id":"R32","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E17"},{"id":"R33","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E19"},{"i
