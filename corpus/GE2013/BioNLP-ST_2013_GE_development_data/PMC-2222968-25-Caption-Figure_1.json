Cells were harvested after 5 days and FOXP3 mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR. Bars show the mean +/- SD of 4 independent experiments.\n(B) In vitro differentiated Th1, Th2, or iTreg cells were activated with anti-CD3/CD28, TGF-beta, or anti-IL-4 as indicated. The phenotype of these cells was confirmed by FACS and proliferation analysis (Figure S1). Bars show the mean +/- SD of four independent experiments.","catanns":[{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":17,"end":23},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":24,"end":29},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":30,"end":40},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":96,"end":99},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":100,"end":104},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":121,"end":129},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":203,"end":208},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":381,"end":384},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":385,"end":389},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":391,"end":399},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":409,"end":413},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E1"}]}
