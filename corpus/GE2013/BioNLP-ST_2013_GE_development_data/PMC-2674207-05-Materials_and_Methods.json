During RNA purification, genomic DNA was digested with RNase-free DNase (Amersham Biosciences). Next, 0.5 microg of total RNA was reversed transcribed using the avian myeloblastosis virus RT (Promega, Southampton, UK). For relative quantification, RT-PCR was carried out using cDNA probes. Primers for IL-4 were from Sigma-Genosys (Cambridge, UK). Sequences of GADPH used are as follows: forward 5'-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGC, reverse 3'-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCAC.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":406,"end":410},"category":"Protein"}]}
