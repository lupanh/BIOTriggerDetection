Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) is a key inflammatory mediator. Secretion of biologically active IL-1beta involves inflammasome-mediated processing. Little is known about the contribution of IL-1beta and the inflammasomes in CF inflammatory disease. This study examines inflammasome-mediated IL-1beta production in CF bronchial epithelial cell lines and human patients with CF.\nResults\nBronchial epithelial cell lines were found to produce negligible amounts of basal or stimulated IL-1beta compared to hematopoeitic cells and they did not significantly upregulate caspase-1 activity upon inflammasome stimulation. In contrast, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from both CF and healthy control subjects produced large amounts of IL-1beta and strongly upregulated caspase-1 activity upon inflammasome stimulation. PBMCs from CF patients and controls displayed similar levels of caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta production when stimulated with inflammasome activators. This IL-1beta production was dependent on NF-kappaB activity and could be enhanced by priming with LPS. Finally, chemical inhibition of CFTR activity in control PBMCs and THP-1 cells did not significantly alter IL-1beta or IL-8 production in response to P. aeruginosa.\nConclusion\nHematopoeitic cells appear to be the predominant source of inflammasome-induced pro-inflammatory IL-1beta in CF. PBMCs derived from CF subjects display preserved inflammasome activation and IL-1beta secretion in response to the major CF pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, our data do not support the hypothesis that increased IL-1beta production in CF subjects is due to an intrinsic increase in NF-kappaB activity through loss of CFTR function.","catanns":[{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":13,"end":21},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":30},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":31,"end":41},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":244,"end":262},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":264,"end":272},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":306,"end":315},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":339,"end":347},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":348,"end":356},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":433,"end":441},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":525,"end":533},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":534,"end":542},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":543,"end":553},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":674,"end":681},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":713,"end":723},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":724,"end":732},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":955,"end":963},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":981,"end":989},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1034,"end":1038},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1154,"end":1162},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1163,"end":1173},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1179,"end":1189},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1225,"end":1233},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1425,"end":1430},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1431,"end":1439},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1448,"end":1458},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1459,"end":1473},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1572,"end":1579},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1597,"end":1605},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1652,"end":1661},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1690,"end":1698},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1699,"end":1708},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1823,"end":1832},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1832,"end":1841},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1842,"end":1852},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1871,"end":1874},"category":"Positive_regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E18","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E19","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"},{"id":"E20","type":"instanceOf","object":"T34"},{"id":"E21","type":"instanceOf","object":"T35"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T3","object":"T2"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E6"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E7"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E8"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E9"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E10"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E11"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"E11","object":"E12"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"E14","object":"E13"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E15"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"E15","object":"E14"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E16"},{"id":"R18","type":"themeOf","subject":"E18","object":"E17"},{"id":"R19","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E18"},{"id":"R20","type":"themeOf","subject":"E20","object":"E19"},{"id":"R21","type":"themeOf","subject":"T14","object":"E20"},{"id":"R22","type":"themeOf","subject":"E19","object":"E21"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E5"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E7"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E13"},{"i
