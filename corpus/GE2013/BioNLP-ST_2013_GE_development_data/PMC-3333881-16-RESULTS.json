{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"3333881","division_id":16,"section":"RESULTS","text":"In HIV-1-infected monocytes Tat sustains the NF-kappaB activity and promotes the transcriptional activation of MIP-1alpha by interacting with IkappaB-alpha and p65\nWe next analysed whether Tat affected the NF-kappaB activity and the expression of MIP-1alpha in the course of HIV-1 infection. To detect the Tat protein, we produced HXB2 Env-pseudotyped NL4-3.FLAG-Tat.R-E- virions, which were used in single-round infection of U937, a human monocytic cell line. Cells were transfected with siRNA Tat, siRNA control or left untransfected to modulate the Tat expression, and then analysed for the kinetic of NF-kappaB activation following viral infection. The expression of Tat and p24 was detected at 3- to 12-h post-infection, while it was barely detected in siRNA Tat-transfected cells (Figure 6A).\nThe NF-kappaB activity, as measured by p65 DNA binding, was induced at 3-h post-infection in both Tat-positive (no siRNA and siRNA control) and Tat-negative cells (siRNA Tat), and increased at 12 h only in Tat-positive cells (Figure 6B). Degradation of IkappaB-alpha was observed at 3-h post-infection, and was followed by de novo synthesis of IkappaB-alpha at 12 h independently of the Tat presence (Figure 6C). Consistently, the IKK activity was induced at 3-h post-infection and turned off at 12 h independently of the Tat presence (Figure 6D). These results agreed with the kinetic of NF-kappaB activation in single-round HIV-1 infection of Jurkat cells (Figure 1), and further supported the requirement of viral expression to counteract the post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB.\nIn HIV-1-infected U937 cells, the endogenous Tat was coimmunoprecipitated with IkappaB-alpha and p65 (Figure 6E), and activated the MIP-1alpha expression in a p65-dependent manner, as shown by the lack of effect following RNA interference of Tat or p65 (Figure 6F). Moreover, Tat and p65 were both recruited to the NF-kappaB enhancer of MIP-1alpha, while the p65 occupancy was abolished by siRNA Tat (Figure 6G and H). Altogether these results indicated that in single round HIV-1 infection Tat associated with IkappaB-alpha and p65, and induced the p65-dependent activation of MIP-1alpha expression through occupancy of the MIP-1alpha promoter and increased recruitment of p65.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":31},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":68,"end":76},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":81,"end":96},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":97,"end":107},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":111,"end":121},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":122,"end":124},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":125,"end":136},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":142,"end":155},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":160,"end":163},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":189,"end":192},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":193,"end":201},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":233,"end":243},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":247,"end":257},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":306,"end":309},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":336,"end":339},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":358,"end":366},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":489,"end":498},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":539,"end":547},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":552,"end":555},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":556,"end":566},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":657,"end":667},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":671,"end":674},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":679,"end":682},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":732,"end":734},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":746,"end":754},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":758,"end":767},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":838,"end":841},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":846,"end":853},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":859,"end":866},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":897,"end":900},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":943,"end":946},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":963,"end":972},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":979,"end":988},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1005,"end":1008},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":1037,"end":1048},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1052,"end":1065},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":1110,"end":1118},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":1130,"end":1139},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1143,"end":1156},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":1165,"end":1178},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1186,"end":1189},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1321,"end":1324},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1629,"end":1632},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":1637,"end":1657},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1663,"end":1676},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1681,"end":1684},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":1702,"end":1711},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1716,"end":1726},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":1727,"end":1737},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1743,"end":1746},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":1747,"end":1756},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":1781,"end":1785},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":1789,"end":1795},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":1796,"end":1805},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1826,"end":1829},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1833,"end":1836},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1860,"end":1863},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1868,"end":1871},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":1882,"end":1891},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T70","span":{"begin":1899,"end":1917},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1921,"end":1931},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1943,"end":1946},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T71","span":{"begin":1947,"end":1956},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T72","span":{"begin":1961,"end":1970},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1974,"end":1983},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2075,"end":2078},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T73","span":{"begin":2079,"end":2089},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2095,"end":2108},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2113,"end":2116},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T74","span":{"begin":2122,"end":2129},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":2134,"end":2137},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T75","span":{"begin":2148,"end":2158},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":
