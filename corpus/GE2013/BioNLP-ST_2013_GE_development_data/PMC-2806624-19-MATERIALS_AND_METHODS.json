The proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare). Unspecific binding was blocked with 3% milk in TBS Tween, and the membranes were subsequently incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit anti-RUNX1 (ab11903; Abcam) or 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-RUNX3 (H-50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in blocking buffer containing 3% milk in TBS Tween overnight at 4degreesC. The blots were developed using an anti-rabbit IgG HRP-labeled mAb (Cell Signaling Technology) and visualized with a LAS-1000 gel documentation system (Fujifilm). To confirm sample loading and transfer membranes were incubated in stripping buffer and reblocked for 1 h and reprobed using anti-GAPDH (6C5; Ambion) and developed using an anti-mouse IgG HRP-labeled mAb (Cell Signaling Technology).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":33},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":38,"end":43},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":60,"end":73},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":409,"end":414},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":465,"end":470},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":877,"end":882},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"}]}
