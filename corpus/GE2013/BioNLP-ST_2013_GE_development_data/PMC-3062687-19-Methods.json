Briefly, cells were cotransfected at a ratio of 10:1 with various promoter-driven firefly luciferase constructs to the Renilla luciferase pTKRL plasmid, together with indicated plasmids. Cells were cultured for 1-2 days and then stimulated in triplicate before harvest. Lysates were analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase Kit (Promega).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":195,"end":205},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":232,"end":242},"category":"Protein"}]}
