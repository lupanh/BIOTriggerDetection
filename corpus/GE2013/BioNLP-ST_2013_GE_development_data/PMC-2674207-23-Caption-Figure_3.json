(B) Time course of the effect of FP (10-8 M) on phosphorylation of activated transcription factor 2 (ATF-2), a measure of p38 MAPK activity. (C) FP-induced inhibition of p38 MAPK activity is associated with the decrease of anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation-induced serine phosphorylation (P-Ser) of GATA-3. For (A-C), quantification of the densitometry data is also shown. Each bar represents mean+/-SEM of at least three independent experiments. ###p<0.001 compared to control, ***p<0.001 compared to alphaCD3/CD28-stimulated cells. (D) FP induced MKP-1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner. All results are representative of at least three independent experiments and where appropriate expressed as means+/-SEM, *p<0.05. (E) FP induces MKP-1 mRNA in a time-dependent manner. Results are representative of two independent experiments. All data except (E) were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.","catanns":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":95,"end":105},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":120,"end":135},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":139,"end":145},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":146,"end":152},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":153,"end":168},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":379,"end":385},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":404,"end":419},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":423,"end":455},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":457,"end":462},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":567,"end":575},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":608,"end":615},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":616,"end":622},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":623,"end":638},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":650,"end":656},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":892,"end":899},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":900,"end":905},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":930,"end":939},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1085,"end":1092},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1093,"end":1098},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1114,"end":1123},"category":"Regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T3","object":"T2"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"partOf","subject":"T9","object":"T1"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E5"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E6"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E8"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E7"},{"id":"R11","type":"partOf","subject":"T15","object":"T4"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E9"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E10"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E11"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"E11","object":"E12"}]}
