We therefore asked whether IL-4 is able to inhibit TGF-beta induction of FOXP3 during the priming of naive T cells. Human CD4+CD45RA+ T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence of TGF-beta and/or IL-4 and harvested after 5 d. IL-4 efficiently repressed the TGF-beta-mediated induction of FOXP3 expression (Figure 5A) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 5B). Low levels of GATA3 were induced also in the absence of IL-4, as it was previously observed [3]. However, at low concentration, IL-4 was able to marginally induce FOXP3 expression. Of note, GATA3 was also induced in the presence of TGF-beta at high IL-4 concentration (Figure 5A and 5B). The IL-4-mediated prevention of FOXP3 expression was not caused by interferences of the receptor signaling, because the phosphorylation of SMAD2 or STAT6 was not affected by the addition of IL-4 and/or TGF-beta, which demonstrates that IL-4 as well as TGF-beta signaling were functional under these conditions (Figure 5C). Increasing amounts of IL-4 increase intracellular GATA3, whereas FOXP3 decreased, which is consistent with the mRNA analysis (Figure 5D). Furthermore, injection of IL-4 into wild-type B6 mice decreased the inducible or natural Treg number in vivo. A distinction of the Treg subsets is not possible, because recently activated iTreg cells also express surface CD25. We used complexes of recombinant mouse IL-4 (rmIL-4) plus anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which have been shown to dramatically increase the potency of the cytokine in vivo [19]. In these mice, the percentage of CD4+CD25+ and FOXP3+ T cells dramatically decreased when the antibody-cytokine immune complexes were injected (Figure S2). Upon administration of rmIL-4 plus anti-IL-4 mAb complexes, the total number of CD4+CD25+ T cell, as well as the Foxp3+ T cells diminished by half (Figure S2G and S2H), confirming that the lower percentage was not due to an increase in the CD4+CD25- cells, but a real decrease of CD4+CD25+ T cells. In conclusion, IL-4 negatively regulates the natural or inducible Treg cell turnover not only in vitro but also in vivo. To study the effects of IL-4 on already-existing human natural or inducible Treg cells, we exposed sorted CD25+ T cells (nTreg cells) to IL-4 and analyzed FOXP3 expression and suppressive capacity. In already-existing Treg cells, IL-4 failed to inhibit FOXP3 expression (Figure S3A), and the suppressive capacity was not altered (Figure S3C). Similarly pre-existing iTreg cells did not decrease FOXP3 expression upon IL-4 exposure (Figure S3B).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":22},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":49,"end":53},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":174,"end":178},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":190,"end":197},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":198,"end":206},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":207,"end":216},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":220,"end":225},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":269,"end":272},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":273,"end":279},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":326,"end":329},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":330,"end":334},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":354,"end":362},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":370,"end":374},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":400,"end":404},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":417,"end":426},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":431,"end":436},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":449,"end":458},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":462,"end":467},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":468,"end":478},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":554,"end":559},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":565,"end":572},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":585,"end":592},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":596,"end":600},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":668,"end":672},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":696,"end":702},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":703,"end":708},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":709,"end":719},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":730,"end":735},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T70","span":{"begin":745,"end":752},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":772,"end":780},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":789,"end":793},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":832,"end":836},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T71","span":{"begin":846,"end":856},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":860,"end":865},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T72","span":{"begin":866,"end":876},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T73","span":{"begin":885,"end":891},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T74","span":{"begin":948,"end":963},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":967,"end":972},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":976,"end":981},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T75","span":{"begin":990,"end":998},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1018,"end":1022},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1030,"end":1038},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1064,"end":1068},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1088},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T76","span":{"begin":1151,"end":1169},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1173,"end":1177},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T77","span":{"begin":1178,"end":1186},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1201,"end":1206},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1216,"end":1221},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T78","span":{"begin":1222,"end":1231},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1315,"end":1319},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T79","span":{"begin":1494,"end":1501},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1510,"end":1514},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1555,"end":1559},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1561,"end":1567},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1579,"end":1583},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":1736,"end":1739},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1740,"end":1744},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1750,"end":1755},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":1882,"end":1888},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":1899,"end":1903},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":1939,"end":1942},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1943,"end":1947},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":1972,"end":1977},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":2099,"end":2102},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":2103,"end":2107},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":2139,"end":2142},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":2143,"end":2147},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":2173,"end":2177},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":2303,"end":2307},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":2385,"end":2389},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":2416,"end":2420},"category":"P
