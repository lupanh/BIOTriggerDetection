Detection of the BMP-6-protein has been tried with the following antibodies: goat polyclonal anti-BMP-6 (Santa Cruz, San Diego, CA, USA), monoclonal mouse anti-BMP-6 and polyclonal goat anti-BMP-6 from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK), and mouse monoclonal anti-BMP-6 (Chemicon International Inc, Temecula, CA, USA).\nCharacterisation of BMP-signalling pathways was done by use of anti-phospho-Smad1, -5, -and 8 polyclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). Expression levels of Id1-3 proteins were detected with polyclonal rabbit antibody and detection was blocked with blocking peptide from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, San Diego, CA, USA). As secondary antibodies served anti-mouse, anti-goat or anti-rabbit IgG- horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from Dakocytomation AS (Copenhagen, Denmark) for immunoblot analysis. Anti-beta-actin was from Santa-Cruz. From Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA), we purchased anti-CD19-PE, anti-CD19-FITC. The antibodies used for cell sorting were anti-CD19 PC5 from Immunotech SA (Marseille, France) and anti-CD27 PE from Becton Dickinson, Biosciences Pharmingen (San Diego, CA, USA).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":112,"end":119},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":121,"end":128},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":130,"end":137},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":139,"end":147},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":152,"end":160},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":228,"end":233},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":309,"end":314},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":371,"end":376},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":402,"end":407},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":469,"end":474},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":600,"end":605},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":607,"end":609},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":616,"end":617},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":669,"end":686},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":690,"end":693},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":694,"end":695},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":769,"end":776},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1040,"end":1050},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1128,"end":1132},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1142,"end":1146},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1204},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1257,"end":1261},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T14","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E1","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E4"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"}]}
