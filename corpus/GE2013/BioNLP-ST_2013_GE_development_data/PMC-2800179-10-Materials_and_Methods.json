Westwick and D.A. Brenner, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) contains three copies of NF-kappaB-responsive element from the MHC class I locus, placed upstream of the luciferase gene. Human monocytic THP-1 cells were transiently transfected as previously described [30], and then cultured for 4 h alone or with increasing concentration of either C10 or C40. Luciferase activity was determined using a luminometer (Monolight 2010 Luminometer, Ann Arbor, MI).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":267,"end":277},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":458,"end":468},"category":"Protein"}]}
