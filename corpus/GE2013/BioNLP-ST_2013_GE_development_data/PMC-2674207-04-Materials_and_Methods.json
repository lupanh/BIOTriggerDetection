PBMCs were isolated by density centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (density, 1.077 g/ml; Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK) as previously described [34]. Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 (1 microg/ml each) for 1 h at 37degreesC to stimulate Th2 cytokine release in the presence or absence of FP (10-12 to 10-8M). Cytospins were prepared and GATA-3 localization determined by confocal microscopy as previously described [12].","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":531,"end":537},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":538,"end":550},"category":"Localization"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T2"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"}]}
