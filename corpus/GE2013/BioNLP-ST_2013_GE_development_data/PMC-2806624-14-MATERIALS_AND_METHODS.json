After a 24-h culture in serum-free conditions and stimuli as indicated in the figures, luciferase activity was measured by the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PMA/ionomycin was used to stimulate the cells, because the transfection was only transient and the luciferase assay required a strong and fast stimulation of the cells. To evaluate the effect of overexpression of RUNX1 or RUNX3 on FOXP3 protein levels, CD4+ T cells were preactivated with 2 microg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) in serum-free AIM-V medium in the presence of 1 nmol/liter IL-2 (Roche) for 12 h, and then transfected with the vector pEGFPN1 containing the RUNX1 or RUNX3 fragment using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa Biosystems) and the program T-23. FOXP3 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry after 48 h of culture in AIM-V medium containing 1 nmol/liter IL-2.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":116,"end":121},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":131,"end":141},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":193,"end":198},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":200,"end":205},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":267,"end":270},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":469,"end":479},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":514,"end":524},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":693,"end":703},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":779,"end":785},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":789,"end":803},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":807,"end":812},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":816,"end":821},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":825,"end":830},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":847,"end":850},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":895,"end":913},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":989,"end":993},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1021,"end":1032},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1072,"end":1077},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1081,"end":1086},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1167,"end":1172},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1173,"end":1183},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1278,"end":1282},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"causeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"causeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E2"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E4"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E5"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T16","object":"E6"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E7"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E7"}]}
