A potential role of BMP-6 in the immune system has been implied by various studies of malignant and rheumatoid diseases. In the present study, we explored the role of BMP-6 in normal human peripheral blood B cells.\nResults\nThe B cells were found to express BMP type I and type II receptors and BMP-6 rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8. Furthermore, Smad-phosphorylation was followed by upregulation of Id1 mRNA and Id1 protein, whereas Id2 and Id3 expression was not affected. Furthermore, we found that BMP-6 had an antiproliferative effect both in naive (CD19+CD27-) and memory B cells (CD19+CD27+) stimulated with anti-IgM alone or the combined action of anti-IgM and CD40L. Additionally, BMP-6 induced cell death in activated memory B cells. Importantly, the antiproliferative effect of BMP-6 in B-cells was completely neutralized by the natural antagonist, noggin. Furthermore, B cells were demonstrated to upregulate BMP-6 mRNA upon stimulation with anti-IgM.\nConclusion\nIn mature human B cells, BMP-6 inhibited cell growth, and rapidly induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 followed by an upregulation of Id1.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":85,"end":97},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":101,"end":104},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":165,"end":173},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":285,"end":290},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":432,"end":437},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":559,"end":564},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":573,"end":580},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":581,"end":596},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":600,"end":605},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":606,"end":607},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":608,"end":609},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":624,"end":628},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":629,"end":644},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":649,"end":657},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":661,"end":673},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":677,"end":680},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":690,"end":693},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":711,"end":714},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":719,"end":722},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":723,"end":733},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":742,"end":750},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":779,"end":784},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":832,"end":836},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":837,"end":841},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":864,"end":868},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":869,"end":873},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":946,"end":951},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":967,"end":972},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1071},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1137,"end":1143},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1187,"end":1197},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1198,"end":1203},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1277,"end":1282},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":1318,"end":1325},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1326,"end":1341},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1345,"end":1350},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1351,"end":1352},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1353,"end":1354},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1355,"end":1363},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":1370,"end":1382},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1386,"end":1389},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T34"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T35"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T34"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T35"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T36"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T36"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T37"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T37"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T38"},{"id":"E18","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E19","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E20","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E21","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E22","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E23","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E24","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E25","type":"instanceOf","object":"T42"},{"id":"E26","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E27","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"causeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"causeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"causeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E6"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E3"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E5"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E7"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E8"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"E10","object":"E9"},{"id":"R13","type":"causeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E9"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"
