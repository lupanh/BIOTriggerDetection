This interaction between GR and importin-alpha was significant at concentrations as low as 10-12 M and was maximal with 10-8 M FP. Subsequent GR nuclear translocation was rapid and sustained at significant levels for at least 14 h (Figure 2B). Using IP-Western blotting we showed that FP at 10-12-10-8 M decreased the association between GATA-3 and importin-alpha induced by anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2C). In addition, using GFP-labelled GATA-3 and confocal microscopy we demonstrated that GATA-3 nuclear import following anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation for 30 min was attenuated by pretreatment with FP (10-8 M) (Figure 2D).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":17,"end":19},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":34,"end":40},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":41,"end":44},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":125,"end":134},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":135,"end":137},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":149,"end":155},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":156,"end":160},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":184,"end":191},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":192,"end":198},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":244,"end":246},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":361,"end":363},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":364,"end":371},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":372,"end":385},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":523,"end":532},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":537,"end":548},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":557,"end":563},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":583,"end":590},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":639,"end":648},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":688,"end":707},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":753,"end":759},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":760,"end":767},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":768,"end":774},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":775,"end":784},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":826,"end":836},"category":"Negative_regulation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"locationOf","subject":"T13","object":"E4"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E6"},{"id":"R8","type":"locationOf","subject":"T13","object":"E6"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E7"},{"id":"R10","type":"locationOf","subject":"T15","object":"E7"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E9"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E10"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E11"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E12"},{"id":"R16","type":"locationOf","subject":"T21","object":"E12"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E13"},{"id":"R18","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E14"}]}
