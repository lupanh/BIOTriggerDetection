To gain new insights into the transcriptional regulation of this restriction factor, we cloned and characterized the promoter region of A3G. Transcriptional start sites were identified by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that a 1025 bp A3G promoter sequence (from -959 to +66 relative to the major transcriptional start site) displayed constitutive promoter activity. In T cells, the A3G promoter was not inducible by mitogenic stimulation, interferon treatment or expression of HIV-1 proteins. Using a series of 5' deletion promoter constructs in luciferase reporter assays, we identified a 180 bp region that was sufficient for full promoter activity. Transcriptional activity of this A3G core promoter was dependent on a GC-box (located at position -87/-78 relative to the major transcriptional start site) and was abolished after mutation of this DNA element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the identified GC-box represented a binding site for the ubiquitous transcription factors specificity protein (Sp) 1 and Sp3.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":8,"end":11},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":12,"end":20},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":27,"end":40},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":54,"end":62},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":68,"end":76},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":78,"end":81},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":160,"end":169},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":318,"end":328},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":332,"end":355},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":408,"end":411},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":506,"end":516},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":709,"end":712},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":713,"end":721},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":730,"end":739},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":873,"end":883},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1301,"end":1307},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1322,"end":1329},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1376,"end":1402},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1407,"end":1410},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T12","object":"T4"},{"id":"R3","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T5","object":"T4"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R5","type":"causeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E3"},{"id":"R7","type":"causeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E3"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E4"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E5"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E6"},{"id":"R12","type":"partOf","subject":"T17","object":"T8"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T19","object":"E7"},{"id":"R14","type":"partOf","subject":"T19","object":"T8"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E7"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"T19","object":"E8"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E8"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E6"}]}
