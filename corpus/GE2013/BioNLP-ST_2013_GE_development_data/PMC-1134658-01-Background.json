{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"1134658","division_id":1,"section":"Background","text":"Members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily play central roles in controlling cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis [1]. These cytokines can be divided into three subgroups: TGF-beta, the activins/inhibins, and the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), of which the latter constitute the largest family. BMPs are 30-38 kDa hetero- or homodimeric proteins originally identified by their ability to induce ectopic cartilage and bone formation [2,3]. Several studies have demonstrated an essential role of these proteins during embryogenesis, and more recently, also in adult tissues [1]. TGF-beta has been intensively studied in normal and malignant haematopoietic cells and is one of the most potent endogenous negative regulators known to date. [4]. In contrast, the effect of BMPs in the immune system has not been widely investigated. In that respect, BMP- 2, -4 and -7 have been found to control differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells [5] and early T cell development [6,7]. BMP-6 has been reported to reduce the number of cobblestone-area-forming cells of normal human haematopoietic cells [8]. Furthermore, BMP-2, -4, 6 and -7 had an antiproliferative and a proapoptotic effect on multiple myeloma cells [9-11]. In addition, by gene expression profiling, BMP-6 significantly increased the predictive value for a multi-gene signature test and was associated with a poor outcome in diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) [12].\nBMP-6, like the other BMP members, signals through ligation and heterodimerzation of BMP type I [activin-like-kinase (ALK)] and type II serine-threonine kinase receptors, which subsequently propagates the signal downstream by phosphorylating Smad proteins. BMP-6 can signal through the ligation of the type I receptors Act-RIA, BMP-RIA, and BMP-RIB and the type II receptors BMP-RII, Act-RIIA and Act-RIIB, which lead to the phosphorylation of the receptor Smads (Smad-1, Smad-5, and Smad-8). The R- Smads then form complexes with the co-Smad (Smad4) and are translocated into the nucleus where they exert gene regulation [1,13].\nGiven the reported role of BMP-6 in B-cell malignancies and haematopoietic progenitor cells, we wanted to explore its potential role in normal human B cells. We studied the effects of BMP-6 on proliferation and apoptosis on resting and stimulated B cells. Furthermore, the expression of BMP receptors and BMP-6 induced activation of the Smad signalling pathway with subsequent regulation of the target genes Id1-Id4, were resolved. Finally, we investigated whether B cells also were capable of producing BMP-6.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":15,"end":46},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":48,"end":56},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":227,"end":236},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":637,"end":645},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":905,"end":911},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":913,"end":915},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":920,"end":922},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1034,"end":1039},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1168,"end":1173},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1175,"end":1177},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1179,"end":1180},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1185,"end":1187},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1321},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1336,"end":1345},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1486,"end":1491},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1537,"end":1545},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1550,"end":1567},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1743,"end":1748},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1772,"end":1780},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1805,"end":1812},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1814,"end":1821},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1827,"end":1834},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1861,"end":1868},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1870,"end":1878},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1883,"end":1891},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":1899,"end":1903},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1911,"end":1926},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1930,"end":1948},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1950,"end":1956},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1958,"end":1964},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1970,"end":1976},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1979,"end":1991},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1997,"end":2011},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2030,"end":2035},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":2045,"end":2057},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":2067,"end":2074},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2143,"end":2148},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2300,"end":2305},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":2389,"end":2399},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2421,"end":2426},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":2427,"end":2434},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":2493,"end":2503},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2507,"end":2523},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2524,"end":2527},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2528,"end":2531},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":2610,"end":2619},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2620,"end":2625},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T35"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T36"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T37"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T38"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T38"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T38"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T38"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T38"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T38"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E18","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E19","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E20","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E21","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E22","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E23","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E24","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E25","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E26","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E27","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E28","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E29","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E30","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E31","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E32","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E33","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E34","type":"instanceOf","object":"T42"},{"id":"E35","type":"instanceOf","object":"T42"},{"id":"E36","type":"instanceOf","object":"T42"},{"id":"E37","type":"instanceOf","object":"T44"},{"id":"E38
