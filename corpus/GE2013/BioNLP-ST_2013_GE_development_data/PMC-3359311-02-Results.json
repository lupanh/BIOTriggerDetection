Cells were stimulated in accordance with the schedule in Figure 1. In CF, airway epithelial cells have been shown to possess a hyper-inflammatory phenotype and produce an exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response [4], [5]. To determine if airway epithelial cells contribute to the increased IL-1beta production in patients with CF, CF and control bronchial epithelial cell lines were stimulated with the inflammasome inducers P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 (PAO1) and LPS followed by ATP. IL-1beta levels in cell culture supernatants were not greatly increased in either the CF or control cell lines (Fig. 2a-d), although a small increase in IL-1beta production was detected in NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cells, but not in S9 and IB3-1 cells, by 24 hours. In contrast, these airway cells were highly responsive to other inflammatory stimuli, such as recombinant IL-1beta, producing large quantities of IL-8 (Fig. 2a-d inserts).","catanns":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":31,"end":38},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":62,"end":70},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":71,"end":85},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":475,"end":485},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":493,"end":502},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":503,"end":511},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":512,"end":522},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":696,"end":704},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":758,"end":767},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":837,"end":845},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":849,"end":857},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":858,"end":868},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1060,"end":1068},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E8"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E6"}]}
