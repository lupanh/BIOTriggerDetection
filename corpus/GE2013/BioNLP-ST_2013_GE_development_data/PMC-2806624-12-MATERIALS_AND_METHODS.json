Naive (CD62Lhi44lo25-) CD4+ T cells (effectors) were FACS-purified from Cd45.1 mice, then loaded with 5 microM CFSE (Invitrogen). Total splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice inactivated with 50 microg/ml mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min were used as APCs. A total of 4 x 105 CD4+ cells (CFSE-loaded CD25- plus Foxp3-GFP+) was mixed with 105 APCs + 1 microg/ml anti-CD3 mAb per well of a 96 well round bottom plate. Proliferation of the effector cells was analyzed by CFSE dilution. Apoptosis of the cells was investigated by annexin V staining and flow cytometry. Positive and negative control gates were made according to T cells cultured only in the presence of IL-2 without anti-CD3/28 stimulation.\nHuman naive CD4+ T cells were isolated by negative selection by MACS from PBMCs and either transfected with a scrambled siRNA or with a combination of RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA. Cells were then cultured under iT reg cell differentiating conditions and mixed with 2 x 105 autologous irradiated PBMCs that were used as APCs and autologous CFSE-labeled CD4+ T cells. T reg cell to responder cell ratio was 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5. To check the proliferation of the CD4+ T cells without suppression, no T reg cells were added in a control group. Cells were stimulated with 2.5 microg/ml anti-CD3 mAb, cultured in a 96-well plate and the proliferation of the effector cells was determined by analyzing the CFSE dilution by flow cytometry after 5 d of culture. Gating on the CD4+CFSE+ T cells enabled the exclusion of APCs and T reg cells.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":35,"end":40},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":42,"end":45},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":47,"end":50},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":88,"end":91},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":92,"end":101},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":109,"end":114},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":120,"end":123},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":141,"end":146},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":146,"end":149},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":159,"end":164},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":166,"end":168},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":170,"end":172},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":175,"end":178},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":224,"end":230},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":425,"end":428},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":449,"end":453},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":460,"end":469},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":515,"end":518},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":675,"end":684},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":814,"end":818},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":832,"end":835},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":836,"end":838},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":864,"end":867},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1003,"end":1008},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1018},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1019,"end":1024},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1198,"end":1201},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1306,"end":1309},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1432,"end":1435},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1613,"end":1616},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T23","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T24","object":"E3"}]}
