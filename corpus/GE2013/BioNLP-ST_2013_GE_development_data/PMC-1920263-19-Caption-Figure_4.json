(A) A3.01 T cells were cotransfected with pGL3-Basic reporter plasmid containing the 1025 bp A3G promoter and 1 microg of Vif expression plasmid, 1 microg Tat expression plasmid or increasing amounts of HIV-1NL4-3 (0.1, 0.5 and 1 microg). After 48 h, cells were harvested for luciferase assay. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to coexpressed renilla luciferase activities. (B) A3.01 T cells were transiently transfected with pGL3-Basic reporter plasmid containing the 1025 bp A3G promoter or with empty vector. Fifteen hour before harvesting for luciferase assay, a subset of the cell culture was stimulated with 20 ng/ml TPA. Forty-eight hour after transfection, luciferase assay was performed. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to coexpressed renilla luciferase activities and the values for the empty vectors (untreated and TPA-stimulated) were set as 1. (C) A3.01 T cells were transiently transfected with the A3G promoter constructs or with the interferon-responsive reporter plasmid pGL2-CVX (GAS). Fifteen hour before harvesting for luciferase assay, a subset of the cell culture was stimulated with 30 ng/ml IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma. Forty-eight hour after transfection, luciferase assay was performed. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to coexpressed renilla luciferase activities. (D) HepG2 cells were used for transfection. The experiment was performed as described in (C). Mean values (+/-SD) of representative experiments performed in triplicate are shown.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":192,"end":195},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":221,"end":224},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":254,"end":257},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":375,"end":385},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":401,"end":411},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":442,"end":453},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":462,"end":472},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":588,"end":591},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":658,"end":668},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":776,"end":786},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":816,"end":826},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":857,"end":868},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":877,"end":887},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1038,"end":1041},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1074,"end":1084},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1164,"end":1174},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1240,"end":1249},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1253,"end":1262},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1301,"end":1311},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1341,"end":1351},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1382,"end":1393},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1402,"end":1412},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T19","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T20","object":"E6"}]}
