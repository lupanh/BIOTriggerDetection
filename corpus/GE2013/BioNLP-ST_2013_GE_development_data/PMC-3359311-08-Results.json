To determine whether CFTR dysfunction alters IL-1beta production, THP-1 cells and PBMCs from CF patients and healthy controls were treated with the CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh172, prior to simulation with live P. aeruginosa. Treatment with CFTRinh172 did not alter IL-1beta or IL-8 production in control subjects or CF patients (Fig. 8a-b). Similarly, IL-1beta production was not different in monocyte-derived macrophages or THP-1 reporter cells treated with CFTRinh172 (Fig. 8c-d). IL-8 (Fig. 8e) and NF-kappaB activity (Fig. 8f) were also unchanged in CFTRinh172-treated THP-1 reporter cells.","catanns":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":37,"end":45},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":46,"end":54},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":55,"end":65},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":252,"end":258},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":259,"end":267},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":268,"end":278},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":469,"end":474},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":475,"end":483},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":492,"end":502},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":562,"end":570},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":571,"end":581},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E7"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E5"}]}
