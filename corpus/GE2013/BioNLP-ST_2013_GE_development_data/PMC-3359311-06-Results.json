We found that stimulation of primed THP-1 reporter cells with heat-killed PAO1 produced the highest levels of NF-kappaB/AP-1 activation (Fig. 6a) and this correlated with IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6b) but negligible amounts of IL-1beta were secreted (Fig. 6c). Stimulation of primed THP-1 reporter cells with live PAO1 did not significantly increase NF-kappaB/AP-1 activity (Fig. 6a) or IL-8 secretion (Fig. 6b) over priming alone. However, IL-1beta production was greatly augmented over primed cells stimulated with heat-killed PAO1 or unprimed cells stimulated with live PAO1 (Fig. 6c). This confirmed that NF-kappaB activation alone is not sufficient for maximal IL-1beta secretion, but increased priming of NF-kappaB is capable of augmenting IL-1beta production and secretion upon inflammasome stimulation. Dependency of these responses on NF-kappaB was confirmed by pharmacologic inhibition of NF-kappaB using the Bay11-7082 inhibitor of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, which significantly reduced NF-kappaB/AP-1 activation (P<0.001) (Fig. 6d) and the subsequent production of IL-8 (P<0.01) (Fig. 6e) and IL-1beta (P<0.001) (Fig. 6f) in response to both heat-killed and live PAO1. These results were also verified in CF and control PBMCs for each inflammasome examined (P<0.001) (Fig. 6g-h). Overall these results confirm that NF-kappaB is an important modulator of IL-1beta production and that increased activation of NF-kappaB augments inflammasome-mediated production of IL-1beta.","catanns":[{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":24,"end":32},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":37,"end":45},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":55,"end":64},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":99,"end":109},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":118,"end":125},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":126,"end":134},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":144,"end":154},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":489,"end":497},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":503,"end":511},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":703,"end":711},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":712,"end":722},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":735,"end":744},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":905,"end":915},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":928,"end":936},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":937,"end":946},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1008,"end":1016},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1192,"end":1201},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1205,"end":1217},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1218,"end":1233},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1235,"end":1240},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1255,"end":1262},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1328,"end":1338},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1370,"end":1378},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1399,"end":1413},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1618,"end":1627},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1631,"end":1639},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1640,"end":1650},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1694,"end":1702},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1716,"end":1724},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1725,"end":1735},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1739,"end":1747},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E18","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E19","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E20","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T11","object":"T22"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E5"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E6"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E7"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E8"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E10","object":"E9"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E10"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E11"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E12"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"E14","object":"E13"},{"id":"R16","type":"causeOf","subject":"E11","object":"E13"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E15"},{"id":"R18","type":"themeOf","subject":"E15","object":"E14"},{"id":"R19","type":"themeOf","subject":"E17","object":"E16"},{"id":"R20","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E17"},{"id":"R21","type":"themeOf","subject":"E19","object":"E18"},{"id":"R22","type":"themeOf","subject":"E20","object":"E19"},{"id":"R23","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E20"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E6"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E9"}]}
