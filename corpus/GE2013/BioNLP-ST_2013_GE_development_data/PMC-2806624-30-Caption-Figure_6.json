{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"2806624","division_id":30,"section":"Caption-Figure 6.","text":"CbfbF/F CD4-cre mouse cells and iT reg cells generated from human naive CD4+ T cells undergoing siRNA-mediated RUNX1 and RUNX3 knock down show a diminished suppressive activity. Experimental setup (A) and results of the mouse suppression assay (B), FACS-purified naive CD4+8- T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre (left) and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice (Cd45.2; right) were activated in vitro with anti-CD3/28 mAb, 50 U/ml IL-2, and 2.5 ng/ml TGF-beta. After 3 d, Foxp3-GFP+ cells were FACS-sorted and mixed with CFSE-loaded naive CD45.1+ CD4+ cells at the indicated ratios. These were then incubated with inactivated splenocytes and anti-CD3 mAb. After a further 4 d, CD45.1+ cells were analyzed for CFSE dilution. (C) As a control, CbfbF/+ CD4-cre CD4+ T cells activated in absence of TGF-beta were mixed with CFSE-loaded naive CD45.1+ CD4+ cells at the indicated ratios. Four days later CD45.1+ cells were analyzed for CFSE dilution. The median division number (of the naive CD45.1+ CD4+ cells in the cultures containing Foxp3-GFP+ cells) is indicated in each of the histograms. One of three experiments is shown. (D) Human naive CD4+ T cells, transfected with RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA and cultured under iT reg differentiating conditions were used in an in vitro suppression assay, cultured together with autologous CFSE-labeled CD4+ T cells, and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. The CFSE dilution of the CD4+ T cell responder cells was analyzed after 5 d by flow cytometry. The T reg/responder CD4+ T cell ratios used were 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5. One of two experiments is shown.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":8,"end":15},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":72,"end":75},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":102,"end":110},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":111,"end":116},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":121,"end":126},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":127,"end":137},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":269,"end":272},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":273,"end":274},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":289,"end":293},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":297,"end":304},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":324,"end":328},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":332,"end":339},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":346,"end":352},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":395,"end":398},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":399,"end":401},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":415,"end":419},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":435,"end":443},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":456,"end":465},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":523,"end":529},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":531,"end":534},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":631,"end":634},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":661,"end":667},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":726,"end":730},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":734,"end":741},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":742,"end":745},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":779,"end":787},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":822,"end":828},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":830,"end":833},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":882,"end":888},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":970,"end":976},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":978,"end":981},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1016,"end":1025},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1125,"end":1128},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1161},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1166,"end":1171},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1172,"end":1177},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1322,"end":1325},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1361,"end":1364},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1395,"end":1398},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1485,"end":1488},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T39"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T40"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T41"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T33","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T34","object":"E6"}]}
