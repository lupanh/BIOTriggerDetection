{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"1134658","division_id":9,"section":"Conclusion","text":"In conclusion, our results show that BMP-6 induces activation of intracellular Smad signalling in mature human B-cells with consecutive production of Id1 protein. Furthermore, we report that BMP-6 has an antiproliferative effect in B cells stimulated with anti-IgM alone or the combined action of anti-IgM and CD40L. Additionally, BMP-6 induces cell death in activated memory B cells and Ramos cells. Taken together, these results provide a rationale to further examine the role of BMP-6 signalling in normal B cell biology as well as in pathologic conditions like B cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":37,"end":42},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":124,"end":135},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":136,"end":146},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":150,"end":153},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":191,"end":196},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":310,"end":315},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":331,"end":336},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":482,"end":487},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"}]}
