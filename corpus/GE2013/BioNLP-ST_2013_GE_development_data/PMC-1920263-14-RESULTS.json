Functionality of the siRNAs directed against Sp1 or Sp3 was confirmed by western blot analysis: protein levels of Sp1 as well as the long and short isoforms of Sp3 were strongly reduced in the presence of 150 or 300 ng specific siRNA (Figure 7A). An unspecific control siRNA had no influence (Figure 7A). We then cotransfected the luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 180 bp A3G promoter together with 100 ng siRNA using an optimized protocol for the cotransfection of plasmid plus siRNA. This resulted in a 31-43% reduction of luciferase activity in the presence of Sp1- or Sp3-specific siRNA compared to the control siRNA. In contrast, no influence on transcriptional activity of the 150 bp fragment, which does not contain the Sp1/Sp3-binding motif, was observed. Thus, both Sp1 and Sp3 factors are mediating transcriptional activity of the A3G promoter.","catanns":[{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":0,"end":9},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":16},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":21,"end":24},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":33,"end":36},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":78,"end":81},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":86,"end":89},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":107,"end":110},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":227,"end":230},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":234,"end":237},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":278,"end":292},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":296,"end":299},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":342,"end":345},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":360,"end":367},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":495,"end":508},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":513,"end":575},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":703,"end":712},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":716,"end":726},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":755,"end":758},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":763,"end":766},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":776,"end":781},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":966,"end":969},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":974,"end":977},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1032,"end":1035},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T17","object":"T11"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E3"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E4"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E5"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E6"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E7"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E8"},{"id":"R11","type":"causeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E10"},{"id":"R13","type":"causeOf","subject":"E11","object":"E10"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E9"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E11"}]}
