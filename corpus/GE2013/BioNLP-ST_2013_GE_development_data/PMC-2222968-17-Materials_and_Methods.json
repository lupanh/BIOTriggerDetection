Proteins were expressed in BL21 Star (DE3)pLysS (Invitrogen) and lysates were purified by Ni2+-chelate column chromatography. Both TAT-linked proteins were more than 95% pure, based on Coomassie blue staining of sodium disulfate acrylamide gels.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":12,"end":15},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":45,"end":50},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":76,"end":81},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":83,"end":90},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":95,"end":111},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":175,"end":178},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":349,"end":352},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"partOf","subject":"T7","object":"T3"}]}
