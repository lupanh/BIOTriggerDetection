Transgenic DO11.10 mice, expressing a T cell receptor for OVA323-339 peptide in the context of H-2d, were backcrossed with mice expressing GATA-3, driven by the human CD2 locus control region (CD2-GATA3) [22], resulting in DO11.10xCD2-GATA3 mice. Mice used for experiments were backcrossed on a BALB/c background for a minimum of eight generations and used at an age of 8-12 wk. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and all animal studies were performed according to institutional and state guidelines.","catanns":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":215,"end":225},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":226,"end":232},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":254,"end":257},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":280,"end":283},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":284,"end":289},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":318,"end":321},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":322,"end":327},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"}]}
