(A) A3.01 T cells were transfected with reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic containing 180, 150 or 120 bp of the A3G promoter. The two G-to-T substitutions introduced into the GC-box of the 180 bp fragment (180mut) are specified. After 48 h, cells were harvested for luciferase assay. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to coexpressed renilla luciferase activities. Mean values (+/-SD) of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown. (B) pGL3-Promoter reporter plasmids containing the regions E1 or E2 (see Figure 1) upstream of the SV40 promoter were transfected into A3.01 T cells. Firefly luciferase activities after 48 h were normalized to coexpressed renilla luciferase activities. Mean values (+/-SD) of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":177,"end":180},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":331,"end":341},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":357,"end":367},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":398,"end":409},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":418,"end":428},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":685,"end":695},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":737,"end":748},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":757,"end":767},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E4"}]}
