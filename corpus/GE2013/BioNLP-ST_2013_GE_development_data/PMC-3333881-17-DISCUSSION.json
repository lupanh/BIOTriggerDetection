{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"3333881","division_id":17,"section":"DISCUSSION","text":"This study reports a novel mechanism of NF-kappaB activation by the HIV-1 Tat transactivator. Based on the evidence that Tat enhanced the transcriptional activity of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB (49,63,64), and physically interacted with the IkappaB-alpha repressor (50,51), we investigated the possibility that Tat could activate NF-kappaB via direct interaction with IkappaB-alpha and p65. To this end, the NF-kappaB activity was monitored in single round HIV-1 infection using RNA interference to silence the Tat expression. By this approach, we avoided the perpetuation of NF-kappaB activation signaling due to subsequent rounds of viral entry in cell culture propagation (30,31). Upon HIV-1 infection, the early NF-kappaB activation occurred concomitantly with IKK activation and IkappaB-alpha degradation in the absence of Tat. Soon after the shut off of IKK activity and new synthesis of IkappaB-alpha, the NF-kappaB activity was kept elevated in the presence of Tat, while it was down regulated upon silencing of the Tat gene. These findings indicate that in single round HIV-1 infection, Tat enhanced the NF-kappaB activity without affecting the IKK activity and the half-life of IkappaB-alpha. Similar kinetic of NF-kappaB activation occurred upon short-pulse of PMA in Tat-transfected HeLa cells, where Tat inhibited the post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB in presence of newly synthesized IkappaB-alpha.\nThe Tat-dependent activation of NF-kappaB correlated with the association of the viral protein with IkappaB-alpha, which interfered with the generation of the IkappaB-alpha/p65 complex. This evidence demonstrated that Tat competed for the binding of IkappaB-alpha to p65 and prevented the IkappaB-alpha repression of p65. As additional mechanism of NF-kappaB activation, Tat associated with p65 and increased the p65 binding affinity to the NF-kappaB enhancer; this evidence was obtained with recombinant proteins indicating that the stronger binding of p65 to DNA was a consequence of direct association with Tat, which likely caused a conformational change of p65. We also demonstrated that the Tat cysteine-rich sequence (C22,25,27) was involved in the binding to the RHD of p65 and NF-kappaB activation. Differently, the Tat arginine-rich sequence (R49,52,53,55,56,57) was required for the binding to the sixth ankyrin of IkappaB-alpha (50,51), and for releasing p65 from the IkappaB-alpha inhibition. Altogether these results demonstrated that Tat abolished the negative feedback regulation of NF-kappaB by hijacking the IkappaB-alpha repressor, shielding p65 from the IkappaB-alpha embrace, and enforcing the p65 binding to DNA.\nFurther evidence of Tat activation of NF-kappaB showed that wild-type Tat, and not the Tat mutants lacking the arginine- or cysteine-rich domains, up-regulated in vivo the expression of a number of NF-kappaB-responsive genes, including MIP-1alpha, CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2. By ChIP analysis, we observed that Tat increased the recruitment of p65 to the NF-kappaB enhancers of the activated genes, and was recovered at the same sites. RNA interference of p65 abolished the Tat occupancy of the NF-kappaB enhancers indicating that the Tat binding to the NF-kappaB sites was mediated by p65. These results were consistent with the evidence that Tat displaced p65 from the binding to IkappaB-alpha (Figures 2D and 3C), and increased the p65 DNA binding affinity through association (Figure 4E and F). Thus, Tat likely increased the recruitment of p65 to the NF-kappaB-dependent promoters by associating with p65 and by interfering with the assembly of p65 with the repressor IkappaB-alpha.\nOf interest, IkappaB-alpha was found associated to the NF-kappaB enhancers in absence of Tat, where it was displaced in presence of Tat. These results suggest a negative regulatory role of IkappaB-alpha in gene regulation through occupancy of specific promoters. Indeed, IkappaB-alpha was found associated with hystone deacetylases at the hes1 promoter, from where it was removed following TNF-alpha stimulation causing histone acetylation and hes1 transcriptional activation (65). A similar mechanism of gene regulation could apply to the NF-kappaB-dependent genes analysed in this study, where Tat could activate the gene expression by removing IkappaB-alpha and promoting the p65 loading (Figure 7).\nThe physiological relevance of Tat cross talk with NF-kappaB was demonstrated in the HIV-1 infection of human monocytes, where HIV-1-encoded Tat protein counteracted post-activation turn off of NF-kappaB, as shown by: (i) sustained NF-kappaB activity by Tat in presence of newly synthesized IkappaB-alpha; (ii) coimmunoprecipitation of Tat with IkappaB-alpha and p65; (iii) induction of MIP-1alpha expression dependent on Tat and p65; (iv) Tat occupancy of the MIP-1alpha NF-kappaB enhancer associated with increased recruitment of p65.\nThis study supports the pro-inflammatory action of Tat through physical interaction with p65 and IkappaB-alpha. Several inflammatory cytokines under the transcriptional control of NF-kappaB are hyper-expressed in HIV-1 infected individuals, including IL-6 (66,67), TNF-alpha (68), and MIP-1alpha (57-62,69-71). In the case of TNF-alpha and IL-6, Tat activated the cytokine expression by binding to the TAR-like stem loop of the 5' transcript, thus likely promoting the transcriptional elongation (33,37,47). Here, we have shown that the Tat-dependent transcriptional activation of a number of pro-inflammatory genes required the assembly of Tat with p65 at the NF-kappaB enhancer together with the displacement of IkappaB-alpha (Figure 5). Thus, in the set of distinct NF-kappaB-responsive genes, Tat acted as a component of the transcriptional initiation complex, which is consistent with previous reports on Tat promoting the transcription via DNA motifs (72,73).\nOverproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines is considered a major mechanism of immune deregulation (26) and neuron dysfunction in AIDS (74,75). In this scenario, inhibition of NF-kappaB activity could lead to a therapeutic strategy for counteracting the abnormal production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in HIV-1 infection. NF-kappaB inhibitors, such as anti-oxidants, proteasome and IKK inhibitors, significantly reduced the HIV-1 replication and the associated inflammatory response (76,77); however, these NF-kappaB inhibitors acted indiscriminately in both HIV-1-infected and uninfected cells. The evidence that Tat activates NF-kappaB through direct interaction with IkappaB-alpha and p65 may lead to specific inhibitors to counteract the Tat pro-inflammatory action.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":74,"end":77},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":121,"end":124},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":170,"end":173},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":222,"end":232},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":242,"end":255},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":312,"end":315},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":352,"end":363},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":369,"end":382},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":387,"end":390},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":500,"end":507},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":512,"end":515},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":516,"end":526},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":785,"end":798},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":799,"end":810},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":818,"end":825},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":829,"end":832},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":882,"end":891},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":895,"end":908},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":970,"end":973},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":1008,"end":1017},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1025,"end":1028},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1097,"end":1100},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":1141,"end":1150},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1189,"end":1202},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1280,"end":1283},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1314,"end":1317},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":1391,"end":1402},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1403,"end":1416},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1422,"end":1425},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":1480,"end":1491},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1495,"end":1512},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1518,"end":1531},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":1533,"end":1538},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":1539,"end":1549},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":1559,"end":1569},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1577,"end":1590},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1591,"end":1594},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1636,"end":1639},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":1640,"end":1648},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":1657,"end":1664},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1668,"end":1681},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1685,"end":1688},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":1693,"end":1702},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1707,"end":1720},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":1721,"end":1731},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1735,"end":1738},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1789,"end":1792},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":1793,"end":1803},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1809,"end":1812},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":1817,"end":1826},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1831,"end":1834},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":1835,"end":1842},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":1952,"end":1960},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":1961,"end":1968},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1972,"end":1975},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T70","span":{"begin":1989,"end":2000},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T71","span":{"begin":2011,"end":2022},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2028,"end":2031},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":2033,"end":2038},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T72","span":{"begin":2046,"end":2052},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T73","span":{"begin":2070,"end":2076},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2080,"end":2083},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2115,"end":2118},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T74","span":{"begin":2119,"end":2141},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T75","span":{"begin":2158,"end":2166},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T76","span":{"begin":2174,"end":2181},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T77","span":{"begin":2189,"end":2192},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2196,"end":2199},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2243,"end":2246},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T78","span":{"begin":2247,"end":2269},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T79","span":{"begin":2295,"end":2303},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T80","span":{"begin":2312,"end":2319},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T
