Initial experiments revealed that surface expression of the BCR was reduced in PKD1/3-/- (and in PKD1/3-/-:Flag-PKD3+ve) cells compared to wild-type DT40 B cells (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Nevertheless, BCR-crosslinking of PKD1/3-/- cells was sufficient to induce the activation of a number of signalling cascades, similar to that observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 3B). Hence, BCR-induced activation of the Akt, mTOR/p70 S6 kinase (as shown by S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation) and MAPK signalling pathways was clearly detectable in PKD1/3-null B cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins as well as an increase in intracellular calcium levels was also observed following BCR stimulation of PKD1/3-null B cells (data not shown). We did observe that the strength of BCR (but not phorbol ester)-induced regulation of the Erk1-RSK1 signalling pathway was reduced in PKD1/3-/- B cells compared to wild-type B cells (Fig. 3B). One interpretation of this data is that PKD enzymes may modulate Erk activation. Indeed, PKD enzymes have previously been linked to the growth factor-regulated Erk signalling in fibroblast and endothelial cell lines [33-35]. However, BCR-induced Erk phosphorylation was also reduced in PKD1/3-/--Flag-PKD3+ B cells (data not shown) suggesting that reduced BCR levels on the surface of PKD1/3-/- (and PKD1/3-/--Flag-PKD3+) B cells may itself impact on the strength of activation of this specific intracellular signalling pathway.\nTo search for other potential PKD targets that may show defective regulation in PKD1/3-/- DT40 B cells, we used a PKD substrate phospho-antibody that recognises consensus phosphorylation sequences targeted by PKD enzymes (LxRxxpS/T) [36]. As shown in Fig. 3C, phorbol ester- and BCR-induced phosphorylation of cellular substrates detected by this phospho-antibody was similar in wild-type and PKD1/3-/- cells and is therefore independent of PKD enzymes. However, pretreatment of both wild-type and PKD1/3-/- DT40 B cells with GF109203X, a bisindoylmaleimide derivative that inhibits PKCs prevented the induction of proteins that contain phosphorylated LxRxxS/T motifs. Thus loss of PKD1/3 enzymes does not globally disrupt the phosphorylation of cellular proteins that contain LxRxxpS/T motifs. This result is perhaps not surprising as LxRxxS/T motifs also act as good substrates for other serine/threonine kinases such as MAPKAPK2. However these experiments do provide further evidence that phosphospecific antisera are not sufficiently selective to be designated kinase specific substrate antisera.\nBCR-induced signalling pathways culminate in the activation of gene transcription events that control B cell survival, proliferation and function. In this context, it has been proposed that PKD family members control of gene transcription through activation of the NFkappaB transcription factor. Thus, PKD-mediated activation of NFkappaB occurs downstream of a variety of different signals, including mROS/oxidative stress, lysophosphatidic acid and the Bcr-Abl oncogene [17,21,23,30,37]. Furthermore, expression of an activated PKD1 mutant enhances HPK1-mediated NFkappaB activation [38]. In B cells, NFkappaB is known to be regulated via DAG and PKCbeta [39,40] but whether PKDs are key intermediaries for NFkappaB regulation has not been explored.\nThe data (Fig. 4A) show that NFkappaB transcriptional activity was strongly induced in both wild-type and PKD1/3-/- DT40 B cells in response to either phorbol ester or BCR stimulation. In contrast, BCR and phorbol ester-induced NFkappaB transcriptional activity was abolished in PKCbeta-/- DT40 B cells (Fig. 4A), although strong activation of PKD kinases (as assessed by autophosphorylation of PKD1 at S916) was observed in the PKCbeta-/- cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, PKD kinases are neither essential nor sufficient to mediate BCR-induced NFkappaB activation in DT40 B cells and hence do not participate in DAG/PKC mediated control of NFkappaB.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":333,"end":337},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":338,"end":339},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":351,"end":355},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":356,"end":357},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":366,"end":370},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":480,"end":484},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":485,"end":486},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":638,"end":645},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":646,"end":656},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":664,"end":667},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":669,"end":673},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":701,"end":721},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":722,"end":737},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":780,"end":790},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":794,"end":798},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":799,"end":800},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":801,"end":805},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1008},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1009,"end":1010},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1132,"end":1136},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1137,"end":1141},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1176,"end":1180},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1181,"end":1182},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1525},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1526,"end":1527},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1536,"end":1540},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1620,"end":1624},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1625,"end":1626},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1635,"end":1639},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1640,"end":1641},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1650,"end":1654},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1844,"end":1848},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1849,"end":1850},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2157,"end":2161},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2162,"end":2163},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2262,"end":2266},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2267,"end":2268},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":2438,"end":2442},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2446,"end":2450},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2451,"end":2452},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2687,"end":2695},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":3319,"end":3335},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":3367,"end":3393},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":3394,"end":3398},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":3415,"end":3419},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":3513,"end":3520},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":3722,"end":3726},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":3727,"end":3728},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":3895,"end":3899},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":3988,"end":4007},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":4011,"end":4015},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":4019,"end":4023},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":4029,"end":4037},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":4045,"end":4049},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T45"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T46"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T45"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T46"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T45"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T46"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T47"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T48"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T49"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T48"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T49"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T48"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T48"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T48"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T48"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T50"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T50"},{"id":"E18","type":"instanceOf","object":"T51"},{"id":"E19","type":"instanceOf","object":"T52"},{"id":"E20","type":"instanceOf","object":"T54"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E2"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"
