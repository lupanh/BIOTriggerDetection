After 4 d, cells were harvested and analyzed for intracellular FOXP3 expression by FACS or gene expression by quantitative RT-PCR.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":37,"end":40},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":51,"end":54},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":57,"end":62},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":69,"end":73},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":339,"end":346},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":441,"end":446},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":447,"end":457},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E1"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"}]}
