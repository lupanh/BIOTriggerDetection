(A) FACS-purified naive CD4+ CD8- T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice were activated in vitro with anti-CD3/28 mAb, 50 U/ml IL-2, +/- 10 nM retinoic acid (RA), and increasing concentrations of TGF-beta. After 3 d in culture, the cells were restimulated with PMA + ionomycin, and then analyzed for intracellular Foxp3 and IFN-gamma expression. One of five experiments is shown. (B) Naive CD4+ T cells from Cbfb CD4-cre or control mice (harboring a Foxp3-IRES-GFP allele) were adoptively transferred into Rag-deficient mice (5 x 106 cells per transfer). 6 wk later, TCRbeta+CD4+ cells from the spleen, mesenteric lymph node (MLN), and lamina propria of the small intestine (LP) were analyzed for Foxp3-GFP expression. Results from one of four CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice with same findings are shown. The data from four sets of mice is shown in C. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U test. *, P < 0.05 between groups.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":23,"end":27},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":28,"end":37},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":38,"end":45},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":80,"end":85},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":87,"end":90},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":125,"end":128},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":130,"end":133},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":148,"end":152},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":156,"end":163},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":176,"end":180},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":184,"end":191},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":231,"end":234},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":235,"end":237},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":251,"end":255},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":320,"end":328},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":438,"end":443},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":448,"end":457},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":458,"end":468},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":514,"end":517},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":532,"end":536},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":537,"end":544},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":574,"end":579},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":585,"end":588},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":630,"end":633},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":634,"end":643},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":691,"end":698},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":699,"end":702},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":821,"end":830},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":831,"end":841},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":868,"end":872},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":876,"end":883},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":896,"end":900},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":904,"end":911},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T30"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T32"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T33"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T16","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T22","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"T25","object":"E5"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E5"}]}
