After 4 h, the cells were washed and activated with soluble anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and TGF-beta (10 ng/ml). Each day, the TAT proteins were freshly added to the medium. FOXP3 expression was measured after 5 d by intracellular staining.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":4,"end":9},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":24,"end":27},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":28,"end":34},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":143,"end":148},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":238,"end":241},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":251,"end":255},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":260,"end":268},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":295,"end":298},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":342,"end":347},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":348,"end":358},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E1"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"}]}
