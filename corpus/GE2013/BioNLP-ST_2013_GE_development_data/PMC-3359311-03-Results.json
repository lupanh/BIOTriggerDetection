There was no significant increase upon stimulation with live PAO1 or LPS+ATP at the times examined (Fig. 3a-b). Because previous studies have indicated a role for caspase-1 in the activation of NF-kappaB through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling [35], we examined whether chemical inhibition of caspase-1 altered NF-kappaB-dependent IL-6 production in response to P. aeruginosa. However, treatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor z-YVAD-fmk (YVAD) did not decrease IL-6 secretion by airway epithelial cells (Fig. 3c).","catanns":[{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":542,"end":549},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":560,"end":569},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":570,"end":574},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":575,"end":585},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":586,"end":600},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":690,"end":698},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":699,"end":703},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":704,"end":713},"category":"Localization"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T3"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T4"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E4"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E6"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E5"}]}
