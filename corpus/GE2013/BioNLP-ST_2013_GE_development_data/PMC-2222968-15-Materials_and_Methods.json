After a 24-h culture in serum-free conditions and stimuli as indicated in the figures, luciferase activity was measured by the dual luciferase assay system (Promega Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were normalized by the activity of renilla luciferase.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":133,"end":138},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":148,"end":158},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":217,"end":220},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":447,"end":457},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":492,"end":502},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":628,"end":638},"category":"Protein"}]}
