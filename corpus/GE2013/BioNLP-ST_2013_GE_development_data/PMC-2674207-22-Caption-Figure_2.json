A positive control for GR association with importin is shown. Quantification of the densitometry data is shown below. Each bar represents mean+/-SEM of at least three independent experiments. *** p<0.001 compared to control, ### p<0.001. (B) Western blot analysis demonstrated a time- (at 10-8 M FP) and concentration- (at 60 min after stimulation) dependent induction of FP-activated GR nuclear translocation measured by IP. Quantification of the densitometry data is shown below. Each bar represents mean+/-SEM of at least three independent experiments. ***p<0.001 compared to control. (C) Western blot analysis of HuT-78 cells treated with FP and anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation demonstrated a concentration-dependent decrease in GATA-3-importin-alpha association at 20 min. Quantification of the densitometry data is shown below. Each bar represents mean+/-SEM of at least three independent experiments. ###p<0.001 compared to control, ***p<0.001 compared to alphaCD3/CD28-stimulated cells. (D) GFP-tagged GATA-3 was overexpressed and cells stimulated (b, c) or not (a) for 30 min with anti-CD3/CD28. The effect of 30 min pretreatment of cells with FP (10-8 M, c) is also shown. All data were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.","catanns":[{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":23,"end":30},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":31,"end":37},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":38,"end":49},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":74,"end":80},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":81,"end":88},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":89,"end":95},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":208,"end":217},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":218,"end":227},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":234,"end":243},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":244,"end":246},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":247,"end":258},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":315,"end":317},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":318,"end":329},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":641,"end":650},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":651,"end":660},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":667,"end":676},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":677,"end":679},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":680,"end":687},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":688,"end":701},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1000,"end":1009},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1010,"end":1018},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1028},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1044,"end":1055},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1299,"end":1305},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1310,"end":1323},"category":"Gene_expression"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E16","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E17","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"locationOf","subject":"T10","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E7","object":"E6"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E7"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E9"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E11","object":"E10"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E11"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E13"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E12"},{"id":"R15","type":"locationOf","subject":"T20","object":"E12"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"E15","object":"E14"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"E16","object":"E15"},{"id":"R18","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E16"},{"id":"R19","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E17"}]}
