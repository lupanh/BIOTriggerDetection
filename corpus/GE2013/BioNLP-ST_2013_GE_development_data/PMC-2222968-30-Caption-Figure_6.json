After 5 d, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (A) and results of six independent experiments are shown in the bar graph below (B). Statistical significance (one-way Anova, Newman-Keuls) is indicated by asterisks (**p <= 0.01, ***p <= 0.001). (C) Kinetic analysis of intracellular GATA3 and FOXP3 staining is shown in panel C following exposure of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells to anti-CD3/28, IL-4 and TGF-beta. Data are representative of three independent experiments.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":19},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":62,"end":65},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":66,"end":72},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":117,"end":120},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":121,"end":125},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":127,"end":135},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":141,"end":145},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":444,"end":449},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":454,"end":459},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":460,"end":468},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":511,"end":514},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":515,"end":521},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":539,"end":542},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":543,"end":545},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":547,"end":551},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":556,"end":564},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E2"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E2"}]}
