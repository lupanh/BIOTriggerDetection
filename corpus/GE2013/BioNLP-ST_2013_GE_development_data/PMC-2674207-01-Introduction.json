IL-4 and IL-13 regulate the expression of IgE from B lymphocytes, whereas IL-5 plays a key role in eosinophilic inflammation [1]. Th2 cytokines are regulated by the zinc finger transcription factor GATA-3, which is predominantly expressed in Th2 cells [2],[3]. GATA-3 determines Th2 cell differentiation and selectively activates the promoters of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 through chromatin remodelling [4]-[7]. The key role of GATA-3 in allergic airway inflammation has been demonstrated in mice by the reduced release of Th2 cytokines in animals treated with dominant-negative mutants of GATA-3 and by local application of antisense oligonucleotides to GATA-3 [8],[9]. Furthermore, conditional knock-out of the Gata3 gene in mice reduces expression of Th2 cytokines in vitro and in vivo [10], and similar results have been reported in isolated murine CD4+ lymphocytes [11]. Finally, knockdown of GATA-3 expression using siRNA in human T cells results in loss of anti-CD3/CD28-mediated Th2 cytokine expression [12].\nIn order for GATA-3 to regulate gene expression, it must translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to access its target genes. Enhanced nuclear expression of GATA-3 following T cell receptor activation was first demonstrated in murine T cells [13] and was recently confirmed in human T cells following T cell receptor and co-receptor stimulation [12]. GATA-3 contains a classical nuclear import signal [14] and is transported into the nucleus by the nuclear import protein importin-alpha (also known as karyopherin-alpha) [12]. Deletion of a region encompassing the GATA-3 nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) region in murine and human cells prevents its nuclear localisation [12],[14]. The affinity of the importin-alpha-NLS interaction is regulated by phosphorylation [15], and we have shown that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a critical role in phosphorylating GATA-3 to enhance its interaction with importin-alpha and subsequent transport into the nucleus [12].\nCorticosteroids are highly effective in the treatment of allergic inflammation, with marked suppression of Th2 cytokines in airways of patients with asthma [16]. Corticosteroids mediate their anti-inflammatory effects through binding to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which then translocate to the nucleus where they interact with glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the promoter regions of steroid-sensitive genes. Alternatively, activated GR interacts with coactivator molecules to suppress the expression of inflammatory genes by inhibiting the action of proinflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) through the recruitment of co-repressor molecules such as histone deacetylase-2 [17],[18].\nNuclear localisation and retention of GR is mediated through the nuclear localisation sequences NL1 and NL2 [19], by nuclear retention signals [20], and by control of nuclear export via a chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM-1) dependent pathway [21]. NL1, which is similar to the SV40 NLS, binds to importin-alpha [22]. NL1 is activated both by glucocorticoid agonists such as dexamethasone and fluticasone propionate (FP) and by glucocorticoid antagonists such as mifepristone (RU486) [23]. NL1 can be mutated, and the resulting GR still translocates to the nucleus in response to ligands, but via interaction with importin 7, an event that requires an as-yet unknown component [23]. NL2 is poorly defined, residing in the ligand-binding domain, and much less is known about its mechanism of GR import [24]. A variety of other factors are also important for the regulation of GR activation and nuclear import including chaperones such as Hsp90 and other immunophilins [24]-[26] and FK506-binding proteins that may be linked to dynein and/or peptidylprolyl isomerase [27],[28].\nHowever, the molecular basis for the inhibition of Th2 cytokines by corticosteroids is not well understood, because the genes encoding IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 do not have any recognisable GRE sequence [29] and are only partly regulated by NF-kappaB in human cells [30]-[32]. Using overexpression and CAT-reporter genes, Lavender and colleagues [33] have shown that GR reduced GATA-3-mediated IL-5 and -13 promoter activity in human CD4+ T cells. The authors postulated that local recruitment of GR may alter the ability of GATA-3 either to bind to its target site, to cause transcriptional up-regulation, or to maintain an environment that is permissive for transcription.\nWe therefore investigated the effects of a synthetic corticosteroid, FP, on GATA-3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in a T lymphocyte cell line (HuT-78) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in vitro. We also studied the effects of inhaled fluticasone therapy on GATA-3 subcellular localization in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with asthma.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":126,"end":144},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":146,"end":150},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":156,"end":161},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":191,"end":195},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":200,"end":205},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":265,"end":269},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":389,"end":395},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":397,"end":402},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":420,"end":429},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":452,"end":458},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":511,"end":520},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":525,"end":534},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":538,"end":542},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":544,"end":548},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":554,"end":559},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":615,"end":621},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":777,"end":783},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":842,"end":848},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":900,"end":905},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1040,"end":1043},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":1072,"end":1081},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1085,"end":1091},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":1092,"end":1102},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1217,"end":1223},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":1253,"end":1255},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":1261,"end":1272},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":1301,"end":1308},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":1312,"end":1318},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":1319,"end":1322},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":1323,"end":1329},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":1346,"end":1353},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":1354,"end":1364},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1368,"end":1374},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":1375,"end":1384},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":1502,"end":1511},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1562,"end":1568},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T66","span":{"begin":1624,"end":1635},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":1645,"end":1652},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1776,"end":1782},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":2070,"end":2074},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":2078,"end":2093},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":2094,"end":2100},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T70","span":{"begin":2104,"end":2111},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":2112,"end":2115},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T71","span":{"begin":2116,"end":2127},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T72","span":{"begin":2422,"end":2429},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2433,"end":2457},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2459,"end":2462},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":2465,"end":2470},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T73","span":{"begin":2476,"end":2487},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T74","span":{"begin":2495,"end":2502},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":2509,"end":2513},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T75","span":{"begin":2514,"end":2522},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T76","span":{"begin":2635,"end":2644},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2645,"end":2647},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T77","span":{"begin":2648,"end":2657},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T78","span":{"begin":2854,"end":2865},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2900,"end":2921},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T79","span":{"begin":2933,"end":2940},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T80","span":{"begin":2941,"end":2953},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T81","span":{"begin":2958,"end":2967},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2971,"end":2973},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T82","span":{"begin":2977,"end":2985},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T83","span":{"begin":3089,"end":3096},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T84","span":{"begin":3100,"end":3107},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T85","span":{"begin":3108,"end":3114},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":3121,"end":3153},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":3155,"end":3160},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T86","span":{"begin":3162,"end":3171},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T87","span":{"begin":3186,"end":3189},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T88","span":{"begin":3225,"end":3230},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T89","span":{"begin":3455,"end":3464},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":3465,"end":3467},"cate
