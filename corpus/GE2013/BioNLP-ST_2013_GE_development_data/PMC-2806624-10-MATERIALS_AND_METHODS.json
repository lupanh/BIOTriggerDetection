For Th1 differentiation conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 5 microg/ml anti-IL-4, and 25 ng/ml IL-12 (R&D Systems). For Th2 conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 25 ng/ml IL-4, and 5 microg/ml anti-IL-12 (R&D Systems). For T reg cell conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 5 ng/ml TGF-beta, 5 microg/ml anti-IL-12, 5 microg/ml anti-IL-4. For Th17 conditions, cells were stimulated with the following: 40 ng/ml IL-2, 20 ng/ml IL-6, 5 ng/ml TGF-beta, 20 ng/ml IL-23 (Alexis Biochemicals Corp.), 10 ng/ml IL-1beta, 5 microg/ml anti-IL-4, and 5 microg/ml anti-IL-12 were used. Proliferating cells were expanded in medium containing IL-2. The cytokine profile of these cells demonstrated that IFN-gamma is the predominant cytokine in Th1 cells, IL-4 and IL-13 in Th2 cells, and IL-17 in Th17 cells (Akdis et al., 2000; Burgler et al., 2009).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":33,"end":36},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":38,"end":44},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":67,"end":73},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":74,"end":83},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":172,"end":175},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":211,"end":215},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":318,"end":322},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":341,"end":345},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":360,"end":365},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":452,"end":456},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":467,"end":471},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":494,"end":499},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":593,"end":597},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":607,"end":615},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":634,"end":639},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":658,"end":662},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":736,"end":740},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":751,"end":755},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":765,"end":773},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":784,"end":789},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":828,"end":836},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":855,"end":859},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":882,"end":887},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":954,"end":958},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1014,"end":1023},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1066,"end":1070},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1075,"end":1080},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1104},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E1"}]}
