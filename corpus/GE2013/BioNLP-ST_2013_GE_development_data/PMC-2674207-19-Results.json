This concentration is close to peak plasma levels obtained from asthmatic patients treated with inhaled FP (500 microg) [27]. Inhaled FP (500 microg) treatment of seven steroid-naive asthma patients significantly reduced GATA-3-importin-alpha interaction in vivo in a time-dependent manner. This produced a >90% decrease in GATA-3-importin-alpha association at 2 h (median [95% CI], 13,494 [6,828-17,829] versus 879 [597-1,165]; p<0.05 Friedman's analysis). However, this did not reach significance using Wilcoxon's post-test analysis (W = 6.00) probably due to low numbers of participants. Similar results were observed when GATA-3-importin-alpha association was measured (Figure 6C and 6D). The lower dose of FP (100 microg) was not effective. The attenuated interaction of GATA-3 did not result from the defective recycling of importin-alpha, as a significant decrease in the abundance of importin-alpha in the cytoplasmic pool was not detected (Figure 6E).\nWe further examined whether inhaled FP could affect cellular localization of GATA-3 in peripheral blood T cells. Treatment with inhaled FP (500 microg) for 2 h significantly increased GR nuclear translocation (Figure 7A) and concomitantly decreased the number of nuclear GATA-3 immunoreactive peripheral blood T cells (37%+/-4.2% versus 58.2%+/-4.95%, p = 0.016, W = 28.0, Wilcoxon's rank test) compared with placebo as measured by immunocytochemistry (Figure 7A and 7B). This was confirmed by Western blotting, which also indicated that this effect was both time- and dose-dependent (Figure 7C and 7D). Thus, inhaled FP (500 microg) induced significant loss in nuclear GATA-3 at 2 h (median [95% CI], 0.40 [0.27-0.53] versus 0.14 [0.11-0.19], p<0.05, W = 21.00, Wilcoxon's rank test) (Figure 7C) and cytoplasmic GATA-3 levels were enhanced by inhaled FP in a dose-dependent manner (median [95% CI], 0.0032 [0.0026-0.0039] versus 0.658 [0.592-0.720], p<0.05, W = -21.00, Wilcoxon's rank test) (Figure 7D). In addition, FP (500 microg) inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation in primary T cells in vivo at 2 h in samples from two patients (Figure 7E).\nTaken together, our data suggest that inhaled FP reduces nuclear localization of GATA-3 in vivo by acutely inhibiting phospho-GATA-3-importin association. This effect may be direct, through competition for importin-alpha or associated molecules, or secondary to an effect on p38 MAPK-mediated GATA-3 phosphorylation via rapid induction of MKP-1. The combination of these two interacting effects can result in complete suppression of GATA-3 nuclear import and thus Th2 cytokine gene expression.","catanns":[{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":4,"end":14},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":44,"end":50},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":51,"end":58},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":59,"end":71},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":172,"end":181},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":182,"end":190},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":205,"end":216},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":225,"end":232},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":233,"end":239},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":338,"end":347},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":416,"end":426},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":539,"end":549},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":550,"end":554},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":559,"end":561},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":567,"end":577},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":582,"end":592},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":597,"end":608},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":612,"end":618},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":876,"end":883},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":884,"end":890},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":906,"end":917},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":936,"end":945},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":959,"end":967},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":975,"end":983},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":987,"end":993},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1009,"end":1020},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1289,"end":1295},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":1311,"end":1322},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1413,"end":1423},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1424,"end":1435},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1439,"end":1445},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":1669,"end":1675},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":1685,"end":1697},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1701,"end":1707},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":1798,"end":1807},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1808,"end":1810},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1811,"end":1818},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":1819,"end":1832},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1895,"end":1901},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":2258,"end":2265},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":2278,"end":2282},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":2286,"end":2293},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":2294,"end":2300},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":2425,"end":2436},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":2437,"end":2443},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T51","span":{"begin":2444,"end":2450},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T52","span":{"begin":2456,"end":2464},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T53","span":{"begin":2489,"end":2498},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":2819,"end":2826},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T55","span":{"begin":2827,"end":2834},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T56","span":{"begin":2835,"end":2847},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":2851,"end":2857},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T57","span":{"begin":2877,"end":2887},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":2896,"end":2902},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T58","span":{"begin":2912,"end":2923},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T59","span":{"begin":3054,"end":3062},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":3063,"end":3069},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":3070,"end":3085},"category":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T61","span":{"begin":3096,"end":3105},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":3109,"end":3114},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T62","span":{"begin":3157,"end":3164},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T63","span":{"begin":3188,"end":3199},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":3203,"end":3209},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T64","span":{"begin":3210,"end":3217},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T65","span":{"begin":3218,"end":3224},"category":"Localization"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf"
