Antigen expression was then analyzed by flow cytometry. A: Histograms of ICAM-1 expression in cells treated with medium only (control), 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or 40 kDa dCGN (C40). B: Fluorescence intensity for expression of the antigens HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, CD14, ICAM-1, and CD58 in cells treated with medium only (control), 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or 40 kDa dCGN (C40). Data are mean +/- SEM.","catanns":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":13,"end":23},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":24,"end":30},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":31,"end":41},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":299,"end":305},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":306,"end":316},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":433,"end":443},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":447,"end":459},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":477,"end":481},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":483,"end":489},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":495,"end":499},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T6","object":"T3"},{"id":"R2","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T6","object":"T4"},{"id":"R3","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T6","object":"T5"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E3"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E4"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E5"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E6"}]}
