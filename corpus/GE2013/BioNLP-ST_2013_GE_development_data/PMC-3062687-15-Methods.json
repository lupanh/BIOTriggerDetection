Bacterially purified glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-IkappaBalpha (1-54), wild type, mutant GST-RPS3, or RPS3 proteins were used as substrates. The in vitro kinase assay was performed as previously described29. Briefly, enzyme (100 ng) and substrate (2 mug) were co-incubated in IKK reaction buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM ATP) or NleH1 reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP) with 0.5 muCi 32P-gamma-ATP (GE Healthcare) added at 37 degreesC for 30 min. The reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":48,"end":55},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":60,"end":68},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":237,"end":245},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":250,"end":254},"category":"Protein"}]}
