To further examine this relationship, PBMCs from CF patients and healthy adult controls were stimulated with PAO1, LPS+ATP, and LPS+Poly(dA:dT), to activate the NLRC4, NLRP3, and AIM2 inflammasomes, respectively. By 24 hours of stimulation, CF PBMCs did not produce increased amounts of IL-1beta (Fig. 5a) or IL-8 (Fig. 5b) when compared to healthy controls. However, we did notice a transient decrease (P<0.001) in the amount of IL-1beta produced by CF cells in response to LPS+ATP at 6 hours (data not shown). Stimulation of PBMCs with P. aeruginosa that lacks exsA (PAO1deltaexsA), a key regulator of type III secretion, produced three-fold less IL-1beta compared to the parental PAO1 strain by 24 hours (Fig. 5a). Inflammasome stimulation without priming did not result in any IL-1beta production in either CF or control PBMCs. Contrary to our hypothesis, these results indicate that PBMCs from CF patients do not display increased production of IL-1beta or IL-8 with inflammasome activation nor do they suggest any increased basal or induced NF-kappaB activity. These results are consistent with our observation that caspase-1 activity is not different between CF and control PBMCs (Fig. 4).","catanns":[{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":30,"end":37},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":38,"end":47},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":59,"end":67},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":514,"end":521},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":522,"end":531},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":543,"end":551},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":650,"end":658},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":686,"end":694},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":695,"end":703},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":716,"end":730},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":819,"end":823},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":880,"end":888},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":900,"end":904},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":905,"end":913},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1023,"end":1029},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1037,"end":1045},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1056},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1182,"end":1191},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1192,"end":1202},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1206,"end":1214},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1218,"end":1222},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T17"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E15","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E6"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E7"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E8"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E9"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"E11","object":"E10"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T6","object":"E11"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"E13","object":"E12"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"E15","object":"E14"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E13"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E15"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E2"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E4"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E10"},{"id":"M4","type":"Negation","object":"E11"},{"id":"M5","type":"Negation","object":"E12"},{"id":"M6","type":"Negation","object":"E14"}]}
