Similarly, GATA-3 was isolated from nonstimulated HuT-78 cells or cells stimulated for 30 min with anti-CD3/CD28 and GR was isolated from FP (10-8 M, 30 min) stimulated HuT-78 cells. These proteins were subsequently refolded in glycine solution. 100 microl of importin-alpha solution (100 ng/ml in TBS) was added to 96-well plates coated with goat anti-importin-alpha antibody. After 1 h incubation, GATA-3 (100 ng/ml in TBS) from stimulated or unstimulated cells were added to the importin-alpha-coated wells. GR (10 or 100 ng/ml in TBS) from stimulated or unstimulated cells were added to some wells. After a further 1 h incubation, the plate was washed and incubated with primary antibodies (a mixture of rabbit anti-GATA-3 and mouse anti-GR, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1.5 h, and then incubated with secondary antibodies. FITC swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, Cambridge, UK) was used for the detection of GATA-3, and rhodamine donkey anti-mouse IgG (Novus, Littleton, Colorado, USA) was used for the detection of GR. FITC and rhodamine levels were measured with a fluorescent micro-plate reader (Bioline, London, UK).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":2},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":3,"end":9},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":271,"end":277},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":377,"end":379},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":660,"end":666},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":771,"end":773},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1168,"end":1174},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1276,"end":1278},"category":"Protein"}]}
