(A) Real-time PCR analysis of CD4+, CD127-, and CD25high T reg cells and CD4+, CD127+, and CD25neg T cells isolated from human peripheral blood showed an increased expression of IL-10, TGF-beta, FOXP3, and RUNX3 mRNA in CD25+ compared with CD25- cells. Bars show the mean +/- SE of three independent experiments. (B) Human tonsil sections were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Tissue sections were stained for FOXP3, RUNX1, RUNX3, and DAPI or isotype controls. HEK cells RUNX1-transfected or not transfected served as additional control for RUNX1 staining. Data shown are representative from one of the three tissue samples with similar results. Bars, 5 microm. Statistical differences were verified by the paired Student's t test. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":10,"end":15},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":16,"end":26},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":30,"end":35},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":62,"end":65},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":68,"end":73},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":76,"end":80},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":122,"end":125},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":128,"end":133},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":140,"end":144},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":165,"end":168},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":171,"end":176},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":183,"end":187},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":246,"end":255},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":256,"end":266},"category":"Transcription"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":270,"end":275},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":277,"end":285},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":287,"end":292},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":298,"end":303},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":312,"end":316},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":332,"end":336},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":502,"end":507},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":509,"end":514},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":516,"end":521},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":553,"end":562},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":563,"end":568},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":569,"end":580},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":588,"end":599},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":633,"end":638},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E10","object":"E9"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E4"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T14","object":"E6"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E8"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T16","object":"E10"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T23","object":"E11"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T23","object":"E12"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E12"}]}
