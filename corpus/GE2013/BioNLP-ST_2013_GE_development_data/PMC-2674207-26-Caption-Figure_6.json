Each bar represents the mean+/-SEM of at least three independent experiments; *** p<0.001 compared with control as determined by ANOVA/Newman-Keuls analysis. (C and D) Co-immunoprecipitation analyses of PBMCs from steroid-naive asthma patients treated with inhaled FP (500 microg via a spacer) in vivo demonstrated decreased association between GATA-3 and importin-alpha. The individual values for each treatment are presented graphically. (E) Representative Western blot showing that importin-alpha expression was unaffected by inhalation of FP. Blot is representative of gels from three participants.","catanns":[{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":23,"end":30},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":31,"end":37},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":38,"end":49},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":74,"end":80},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":81,"end":88},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":89,"end":101},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":247,"end":255},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":256,"end":267},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":276,"end":282},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":637,"end":646},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":647,"end":658},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":667,"end":673},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T5"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"locationOf","subject":"T7","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E6","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E6"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E8"}]}
