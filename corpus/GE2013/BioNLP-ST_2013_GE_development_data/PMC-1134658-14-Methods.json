Total protein (30-100 mug) from each sample was run on 10% or 12% SDS/polyacrylamide (SDS/PAGE) gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters (Protran; Schleicher &Schuell GmbH, Dassel, Germany). Blocking, washing and incubation of the filters with primary antibodies were done according to the manufacturer's protocols at room temperature (RT). After washing with TBS/0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T), the filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) coupled to relevant secondary antibodies (see above) for 60 minutes at RT. Enzyme activity was visualised by the enhanced chemiluminescence system, ECL+PLUS (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). Densitometric analysis was performed by scanning hyperfilms on a Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Quantification of Id1, Id2 and Id3 protein was calculated by normalizing the specific protein bands to beta-actin using Image Quant 5.5 software (Molecular Dynamics).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":999,"end":1002},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1007},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1012,"end":1015},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1084,"end":1094},"category":"Protein"}]}
