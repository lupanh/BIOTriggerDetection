GATA-3 was excised from pOTB7 using XhoI digestion and pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) was digested with BamHI. DNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and both the GATA-3 fragment and the pEGFP-C2 vector blunt-ended by incubation with Klenow (Bioline Bio-27029) for 30 min at 37degreesC. Klenow was inactivated by incubation for 10 min at 75degreesC. DNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and both the blunt-ended GATA-3 fragment and the GFP vector were subsequently digested with EcoRI before the 5'-EcoRI/3'-blunt end GATA-3 fragment was inserted into the 5'-EcoRI/3'-blunt ended GFP vector. Positive clones were confirmed by digestion and size analysis by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and by sequencing.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":7,"end":10},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":25,"end":31},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":143,"end":149},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":171,"end":177},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":207,"end":211},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":295,"end":300},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":381,"end":387},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":659,"end":665},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":683,"end":686},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":726,"end":731},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":765,"end":771},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":827,"end":830},"category":"Protein"}]}
