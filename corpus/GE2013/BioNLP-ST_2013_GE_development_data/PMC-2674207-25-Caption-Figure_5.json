(B) Western blot analysis showing that FP (10-8 M) does not affect whole-cell GATA-3 degradation over 17 h. (C) GFP-tagged GATA-3 is overexpressed and cells stimulated (b-j) or not (a) with anti-CD3/CD28. The effect of treating cells with FP (10-8 M, f-j) after 30 min stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 is also shown. (D) FP (10-8 M) does not prevent anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated p65 nuclear translocation at 60 min after stimulation. **p<0.01 compared to unstimulated cells. All results are representative of at least four independent experiments and are shown as mean+/-SEM. Results were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test.","catanns":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":32,"end":38},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":39,"end":45},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":54,"end":60},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":159,"end":165},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":196,"end":203},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":218,"end":228},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":229,"end":235},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":236,"end":243},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":244,"end":256},"category":"Localization"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":435,"end":441},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":453,"end":459},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":460,"end":471},"category":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":498,"end":504},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":715,"end":722},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":737,"end":747},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":748,"end":751},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":752,"end":759},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":760,"end":773},"category":"Localization"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T6"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T7"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T8"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T9"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T12"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T13"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T14"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T15"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T16"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"E4","object":"E3"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E6"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E5"},{"id":"R7","type":"locationOf","subject":"T11","object":"E5"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E8"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"E10","object":"E9"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"E10","object":"E11"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E10"},{"id":"R13","type":"locationOf","subject":"T17","object":"E10"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E1"},{"id":"M2","type":"Negation","object":"E3"},{"id":"M3","type":"Negation","object":"E7"},{"id":"M4","type":"Negation","object":"E9"}]}
