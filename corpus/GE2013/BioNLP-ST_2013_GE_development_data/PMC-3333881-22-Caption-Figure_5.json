{"source_db":"PMC","source_id":"3333881","division_id":22,"section":"Caption-Figure 5.","text":"Tat activates the p65-dependent expression of NF-kappaB-responsive genes by occupying the NF-kappaB enhancers and promoting the p65 recruitment with IkappaB-alpha displacement. HeLa cells (5 x 106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat, p3xFLAG-Tat C(22,25,27), p3xFLAG-Tat R(49-57) or empty vector (10 microg); for p65 RNA interference, cells (5 x 106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat (10 microg) and siRNA p65 or siRNA control (200 pmol). Twenty-four-hour post-transfection, total RNA was extracted and analysed by real-time PCR to evaluate the expression of MIP-1alpha (A), CSF3 (B), LTA (C), NFKBIA (D), TLR2 (E), GAPDH (F), ACTB (G) genes. (H) HeLa cells (5 x 106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat, or empty vector (10 microg) and 48 h later ChIP was performed with anti-p65 antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for the indicated promoters. (I) HeLa cells (5 x 106) were transfected with empty vector, or p3xFLAG-Tat (10 microg) in presence or absence of siRNA p65, or siRNA control (200 pmol); 48 h later, ChIP was performed with anti-FLAG antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for the indicated promoters. (J) HeLa cells (5 x 106) were transfected with empty vector, p3xFLAG-Tat (10 microg), or empty vector plus siRNA IkappaB-alpha or siRNA control (200 pmol); 48 h later, ChIP was performed with anti-IkappaB-alpha antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for the indicated promoters. Values (mean +/- SE, n = 3) are shown. The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the control (empty vector) according to the Student's t-test (P < 0.05).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":18,"end":21},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":76,"end":85},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":114,"end":123},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":128,"end":131},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":132,"end":143},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":149,"end":162},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":163,"end":175},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":228,"end":231},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":241,"end":256},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":266,"end":278},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":312,"end":315},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":320,"end":332},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":380,"end":383},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":400,"end":409},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":545,"end":555},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":559,"end":569},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":575,"end":579},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":585,"end":588},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":594,"end":600},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":606,"end":610},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":616,"end":621},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":627,"end":631},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":698,"end":701},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":940,"end":943},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":982,"end":991},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1226,"end":1229},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1264,"end":1283},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"causeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E2"},{"id":"R4","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R5","type":"causeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E4"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"},{"id":"R7","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E5"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E5"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E6"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E7"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T12","object":"E8"},{"id":"R12","type":"themeOf","subject":"T13","object":"E9"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T14","object":"E10"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E11"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"T16","object":"E12"},{"id":"R16","type":"themeOf","subject":"T17","object":"E13"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Negation","object":"E5"},{"id":"M2","type":"Speculation","object":"E7"},{"id":"M3","type":"Speculation","object":"E8"},{"id":"M4","type":"Speculation","object":"E9"},{"id":"M5","type":"Speculation","object":"E10"},{"id":"M6","type":"Speculation","object":"E11"},{"id":"M7","type":"Speculation","object":"E12"},{"id":"M8","type":"Speculation","object":"E13"}]}
