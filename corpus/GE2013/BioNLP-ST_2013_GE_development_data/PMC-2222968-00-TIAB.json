FOXP3 is an essential transcription factor for natural, thymus-derived (nTreg) and inducible Treg (iTreg) commitment; however, the mechanisms regulating its expression are as yet unknown. We describe a mechanism controlling iTreg polarization, which is overruled by the Th2 differentiation pathway. We demonstrated that interleukin 4 (IL-4) present at the time of T cell priming inhibits FOXP3. This inhibitory mechanism was also confirmed in Th2 cells and in T cells of transgenic mice overexpressing GATA-3 in T cells, which are shown to be deficient in transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-mediated FOXP3 induction. This inhibition is mediated by direct binding of GATA3 to the FOXP3 promoter, which represses its transactivation process. Therefore, this study provides a new understanding of tolerance development, controlled by a type 2 immune response. IL-4 treatment in mice reduces iTreg cell frequency, highlighting that therapeutic approaches that target IL-4 or GATA3 might provide new preventive strategies facilitating tolerance induction particularly in Th2-mediated diseases, such as allergy.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":27,"end":34},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":35,"end":44},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":45,"end":52},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":53,"end":58},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":59,"end":69},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":339,"end":344},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":481,"end":491},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":492,"end":495},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":496,"end":506},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":659,"end":672},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":674,"end":678},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":718,"end":726},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":727,"end":732},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":826,"end":840},"category":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":841,"end":847},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":882,"end":891},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":895,"end":929},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":933,"end":941},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":942,"end":947},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":948,"end":957},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":959,"end":974},"category":"Anaphora"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":978,"end":986},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":997,"end":1004},"category":"Binding"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1008,"end":1013},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1021,"end":1026},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1027,"end":1035},"category":"Entity"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1199,"end":1203},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1298,"end":1304},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1305,"end":1309},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1313,"end":1318},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T18"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T19"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T20"},{"id":"E4","type":"instanceOf","object":"T21"},{"id":"E5","type":"instanceOf","object":"T22"},{"id":"E6","type":"instanceOf","object":"T23"},{"id":"E7","type":"instanceOf","object":"T24"},{"id":"E8","type":"instanceOf","object":"T25"},{"id":"E9","type":"instanceOf","object":"T26"},{"id":"E10","type":"instanceOf","object":"T27"},{"id":"E11","type":"instanceOf","object":"T28"},{"id":"E12","type":"instanceOf","object":"T29"},{"id":"E13","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"},{"id":"E14","type":"instanceOf","object":"T31"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T16","object":"T4"},{"id":"R2","type":"coreferenceOf","subject":"T17","object":"T25"},{"id":"R4","type":"equivalentTo","subject":"T6","object":"T5"},{"id":"R5","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R6","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R7","type":"causeOf","subject":"T2","object":"E2"},{"id":"R8","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E3"},{"id":"R9","type":"themeOf","subject":"E5","object":"E4"},{"id":"R10","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E5"},{"id":"R11","type":"themeOf","subject":"T7","object":"E6"},{"id":"R12","type":"causeOf","subject":"T5","object":"E6"},{"id":"R13","type":"themeOf","subject":"T8","object":"E7"},{"id":"R14","type":"themeOf","subject":"E9","object":"E8"},{"id":"R15","type":"themeOf","subject":"E10","object":"E9"},{"id":"R16","type":"causeOf","subject":"T9","object":"E9"},{"id":"R17","type":"themeOf","subject":"T10","object":"E10"},{"id":"R18","type":"themeOf","subject":"E8","object":"E11"},{"id":"R19","type":"causeOf","subject":"E12","object":"E11"},{"id":"R20","type":"themeOf","subject":"T11","object":"E12"},{"id":"R21","type":"themeOf","subject":"T30","object":"E12"},{"id":"R22","type":"partOf","subject":"T30","object":"T12"},{"id":"R23","type":"themeOf","subject":"T14","object":"E13"},{"id":"R24","type":"themeOf","subject":"T15","object":"E14"}],"modanns":[{"id":"M1","type":"Speculation","object":"E4"}]}
