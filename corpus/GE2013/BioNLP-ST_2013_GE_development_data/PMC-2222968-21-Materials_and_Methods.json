The proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Amersham Life Science). Unspecific binding was blocked with BSA, and the membranes were subsequently incubated with an 1:200 dilution of goat anti-FOXP3 in blocking buffer (Abcam) overnight at 4 degreesC. The blots were developed using an anti-goat HRP-labeled mAb (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized with a LAS 1000 camera (Fuji). Membranes were incubated in stripping buffer and re-blocked for 1 h. The membranes were re-probed using anti-GATA3 (HG3-31; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-T-bet (4B10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GAPDH (6C5, Ambion), anti-phospho-SMAD2 (138D4), anti-phospho-STAT6 (5A4), and anti-STAT6 (Cell Signaling Technology),","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":22,"end":27},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":67,"end":70},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":71,"end":75},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":406,"end":411},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":702,"end":707},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":749,"end":754},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":794,"end":799},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":828,"end":833},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":856,"end":861},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":878,"end":883},"category":"Protein"}]}
