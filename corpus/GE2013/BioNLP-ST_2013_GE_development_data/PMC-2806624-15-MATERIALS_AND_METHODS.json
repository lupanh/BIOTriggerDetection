Five different Silencer or Silencer Select Pre-designed siRNAs for RUNX1 (Applied Biosystems) and three Silencer Pre-designed siRNAs for RUNX3 (Applied Biosystems) were tested, and the best was selected for all further experiments. The Silencer Negative Control #1 siRNA (Applied Biosystems) was used for normalization. Cells were then left unstimulated or were stimulated after 12 h with anti-CD2, anti-CD3, and anti-CD28. Cells were cultured in serum-free AIM-V medium with the addition of 1 nmol/l IL-2 (Roche). Cells were harvested for mRNA detection of the target genes after 24 h and for protein detection after 48 h.","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":18,"end":21},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":32,"end":35},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":260,"end":266},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":271,"end":276},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":330,"end":336},"category":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":341,"end":346},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":598,"end":601},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":608,"end":611},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":622,"end":626},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":662,"end":667},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":705,"end":709},"category":"Protein"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T10"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T11"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"T3","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"T4","object":"E2"}]}
