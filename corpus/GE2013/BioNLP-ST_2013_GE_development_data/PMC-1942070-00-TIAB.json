Previously we have shown that PKDs have an essential role in regulating class II histone deacetylases in DT40 B-cells [Matthews, S.A., Liu, P., Spitaler, M., Olson, E.N., McKinsey, T.A., Cantrell, D.A. and Scharenberg, A.M. (2006) Essential role for protein kinase D family kinases in the regulation of class II histone deacetylases in B lymphocytes. Mol. Cell Biol. 26, 1569-1577]. We now show that PKDs are also required to regulate HSP27 phosphorylation in DT40 B-cells. However, in contrast to previous observations in other cell types, PKD enzymes do not regulate basic cellular processes such as proliferation or survival responses, nor NFkappaB transcriptional activity downstream of the B cell antigen receptor. Thus, PKDs have a selective role in DT40 B-cell biology.","catanns":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":671,"end":679},"category":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":683,"end":691},"category":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":692,"end":697},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":698,"end":713},"category":"Phosphorylation"}],"insanns":[{"id":"E1","type":"instanceOf","object":"T2"},{"id":"E2","type":"instanceOf","object":"T3"},{"id":"E3","type":"instanceOf","object":"T4"}],"relanns":[{"id":"R1","type":"themeOf","subject":"E2","object":"E1"},{"id":"R2","type":"themeOf","subject":"E3","object":"E2"},{"id":"R3","type":"themeOf","subject":"T1","object":"E3"}]}
