All experiments in this study were performed under serum-free conditions as FCS has been shown to interfere with BMP-signalling [14](own observations). To study the effect of BMP-6 on proliferation, B-cells from healthy volunteers were stimulated with anti-IgM and/or CD40L in the presence or absence of BMP-6 for three days. We found that BMP-6 led to a 35% mean reduction of anti-IgM- induced DNA synthesis (n = 8; p <= 0.0002, Figure 1A). Similar results were obtained for B cells treated with anti-IgM and CD40L (26% mean reduction, n = 6; p <= 0.023). The BMP-6-induced inhibition of proliferation was dose-dependent in both peripheral B cells (Figure 1B) and the Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos (40% reduction of DNA synthesis, Figure 1C). The BMP-6 effects could be reversed by addition of the extracellular inhibitor Noggin (Figure 1D). Similarly, a combination of the soluble BMP receptors BMP-RIB-Fc and BMP-RII-Fc also neutralized the effects of BMP-6 (data not shown). Next, we wanted to test whether BMP-6 had different effect on naive and memory B cells. Naive (CD19+CD27-) and memory (CD19+CD27+) B cells were isolated from peripheral blood by cell sorting of immunobead-isolated CD19+ B cells [15], and tested for their capacity to proliferate in the presence of BMP-6. However, BMP-6 inhibited anti-IgM induced DNA synthesis in the two subpopulations to a similar extent, with a mean reduction of DNA-synthesis of 45% (n = 5; p <= 0,004) for naive B cells and 48% (n = 5; p <= 0,001) for memory B cells (Figure 1E).","catanns":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":78,"end":83},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":171,"end":176},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":377,"end":382},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":470,"end":475},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":506,"end":511},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":542,"end":547},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":712,"end":717},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":763,"end":768},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":953,"end":958},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1028,"end":1034},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1102,"end":1109},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1117,"end":1124},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1160,"end":1165},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1216,"end":1221},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1279,"end":1283},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1284,"end":1288},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1303,"end":1307},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1308,"end":1312},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1398,"end":1402},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1482,"end":1487},"category":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1498,"end":1503},"category":"Protein"}]}
